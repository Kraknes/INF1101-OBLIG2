In mathematics, a natural bundle is any fiber bundle associated to the s-frame bundle F^s(M) for some s \geq 1. It turns out that its transition functions depend functionally on local changes of coordinates in the base manifold M together with their partial derivatives up to order at most s. The concept of a natural bundle was introduced by Albert Nijenhuis as a modern reformulation of the classical concept of an arbitrary bundle of geometric objects. An example of natural bundle (of first order) is the tangent bundle TM of a manifold M. ==Notes== ==References== * * * Category:Differential geometry Category:Manifolds Category:Fiber bundles
