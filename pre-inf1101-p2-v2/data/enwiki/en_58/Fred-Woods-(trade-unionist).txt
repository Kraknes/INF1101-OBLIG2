Fred C. Woods (died 16 April 1961) was a British trade union leader. Woods worked for the Post Office and first joined a trade union in 1908. This became part of the Union of Post Office Workers, and Woods slowly rose to prominence, serving on its executive committee from 1933, and as its full-time London district secretary from 1936. By the end of the decade, he was also serving as president and acting assistant secretary of the union, but he resigned in 1940 to join the National Union of Clerks. This was about to merge with the Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries, and he was appointed as the first general secretary of the new union, the Clerical and Administrative Workers' Union, taking up the post at the start of 1941.Trades Union Congress, "Obituary: F.
