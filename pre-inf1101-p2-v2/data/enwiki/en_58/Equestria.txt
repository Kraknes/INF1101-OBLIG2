Equestria () is a fictional nation used as the primary setting for the films, comics, video games, and animated television series My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic and My Little Pony: Pony Life. Equestria hosts many intelligent and sapient creatures; the majority being ponies. Equestria resides on the Equestrian continent on a terrestrial planet, similar to Earth. Equestria serves as the backdrop for the adventures of Twilight Sparkle and her friends, in their quest to spread the magic of friendship throughout the land. Leading Equestria are four powerful regnant coregency princesses: Celestia, the Princess of the Day; Luna, the Princess of the Night and Dreams; Cadence, the Princess of Love and Family; and Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Magic and Friendship. Equestria's foundation is described as the result of the cooperation of unicorns, pegasi, and earth ponies, who came together in harmony to fight the Wendigos and stop an eternal blizzard; Hearth's Warming Day is an annual holiday that celebrates its founding. The "Bit" is the official currency of Equestria and its territories. Instead of English, it is mentioned that they call their language "Ponish"; however, due to the fact that written English is seen at several times during the series, it is generally understood that this is English under a different name. Although generally peaceful, Equestria had its share of wars and battles over the centuries, with recent conflicts involving the formerly hostile Changeling Hive, the invading Storm Empire, and the return of the Wendigos; all of which negatively impacting major settlements. Equestria was founded in the Age of Heroes by Princess Celestia and Princess Luna; two sisters ruled as equals until Luna fell to evil and became Nightmare Moon. After a thousand years of banishment, Luna returned and nearly took over the realm, but was soon defeated by that generations' Bearers of Harmony and brought back to her senses, becoming once again the benevolent co-ruler of the nation. After several years of ruling the land, both sisters agreed that their protege, Twilight Sparkle, would succeed them. ==History== ===Pre-Equestrian history=== *The First Emperor of Ancient Equestria - Grogar, Father of Monsters, is first mentioned in "A Flurry Of Emotions", and first seen in "The Beginning of the End". Before The Three Tribes united as one, Grogar ruled the land that would become Equestria. He created terrible monsters to terrorize the populace; many of his creations have continued to terrorize Equestria to present day. He was confronted by a pony named Gusty the Great; Gusty took his magic bell and weakened him, and thusly, he was banished. *The Cutie Pox Epidemic - During the "Paleopony Period," a "cutie pox" epidemic afflicted the population of ponies. Random cutie marks appear all over ponies' bodies, causing them to uncontrollably perform the talents that come with them. The cause of the breakout is never discovered, and the cutie pox disappears as mysteriously as it arrives. *The Greatest Hero Who Ever Lived - Star Swirl the Bearded was, according to Twilight, "the leading expert at everything: Transfiguration, Dimensional-calibration, Teleportation, etc..." In his attempts to create "time spells", he instead created an "age reversal spell" and successfully used it on himself. Starswirl creates more than two hundred spells and has a wing in the Canterlot Archives dedicated to him. Over time, he created dozens of portal mirrors linking to various worlds, and traveled throughout the multiverse, accumulating vast sums of knowledge. Before his self-imposed banishment, Star Swirl participated in many important events in Equestria's early history, and is stated to have lived, at minimum, one thousand years.Luna EclipsedIt's About Time ===Old Equestria history=== ====The Founding of Equestria==== The Fire of Friendship - The Age of Eternal Winter was a time of darkness and frozen ice that "topples the tribes' precarious peace." It was caused by the Wendigos, who fed off of the hatred between the three pony tribes. Earth ponies, unicorns, and pegasi tribes lived under extremely hostile conditions. The Pony tribe leaders set out to find a new land. When they all discover the same land at the same time, their feud starts over, attracting the windigos and causing another blizzard. As the tribe leaders freeze, their cohorts become friends, and the Fire of Friendship is created. The tribe leaders thaw out of the ice, make peace, and agree to share the land as one unified nation. "Hearth's Warming Eve" describes the founding of Equestria as the result of when the pegasi, unicorns and earth ponies united to defeat the Wendigos and prevent an eternal blizzard. *The First Summer Sun Celebration - Before the arrival of Celestia and Luna, Equestria was suffering terrible hardships. Raising and lowering the sun and the moon every morning and evening required five great unicorn sorcerers to perform, and the strain placed upon them consumed so much magic they lost their powers forever. When the leaders of Equestria discovered two alicorn sisters with the talent to move the celestial bodies without draining their magic, they moved to coronate the sisters as rulers of Equestria and entrusted Starswirl with the responsibility of raising and mentoring the alicorn sisters.

Though they succeeded, Luna's heart is permanently tainted by evil, foreshadowing future events. Star Swirl, ashamed by his failure to protect Celestia and Luna, abandons his portal research. Most of the Magic Mirrors are subsequently destroyed. *The Return of the Pony of Shadows - When an evil, alicorn-like monster called the "Pony of Shadows" arose from the abyss, Star Swirl determined that the only way to save Equestria was to send the Pony of Shadows to Limbo, a space between worlds and universes; however, to complete this task, it was needed for the Pillars to send themselves to Limbo as well.

As with Twilight, Celestia ordered Sunset to make new friends; however, with Sunset's repeated failures at making friends, Celestia tried to teach her patience and humility, using one of Starswirl's surviving magic mirrors. Her plan backfired when Sunset witnessed a possible future of herself as an alicorn. At first, the projection was of a beautiful and powerful pony, but soon became into a dark, wrathful pony who sought only to control others. Sunset was mortified by the reflection within herself, but grew ever curious. Her obsession with the mirror grew as Sunset disobeyed Celestia's orders by repeatedly breaking into the Forbidden Dark Magic wing of the Royal Library of Equestria. After weeks, Sunset and Celestia blew up at each other, leading to Celestia to denounce Sunset as her protege. Enraged, Sunset escaped into the mirror and entered the human world; the portal connecting the two worlds would not open again for another three years.My Little Pony: Equestria Girlshttps://sta.sh/22b71lxow6e3https://comicvine.gamespot.com/my-little-pony- annual-2013-1-equestria-girls- the-f/4000-431462/https://comicbook.com/category/equestria-girls-the-fall-of- sunset-shimmer-comicissue-1/ ====The Cutie Mark Chronicles==== *The First Sonic Rainboom - Approximately twenty years before Luna's Redemption.My Little Pony: IDW 20/20 Rainbow Dash broke the speed of sound and magic during a race, creating a phenomenon known as a sonic rainboom.

Twilight establishes the Council of Friendship with her friends. ===Twilightian Equestria history=== ==== Season 9 ==== * The Last Problem - Celestia and Luna have retired, with Twilight as the official sovereign ruler of Equestria, and Spike as her regent and royal advisor. Twilight takes ownership of the School for Gifted Unicorns. Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo become full-time teachers at the School of Friendship. Luster Dawn moves to Ponyville. Gallus is the current captain of the Royal Guard, and Rainbow Dash commands the Wonderbolts. Lyra and Sweetie Drops marry. Derpy publishes a muffin-themed cookbook. Pinkie Pie and Cheese Sandwich marry and have a son. Big McIntosh and Sugar Belle have a son. Rarity opens new boutiques for non-ponies and hires Yona as an employee at Carousel Boutique.The Ending of the End - Part 1 & Part 2 In regards to Twilight's immortality, it is currently unknown how Meghan McCarthy's comment regarding "Twilight will not outlive her friends" will be resolved in the future."We don't know how long everyone lives, Twilight included." "Her friends have been exposed to a LOT of special magic over the years, so who knows how it's affected them?" ===Alternate continuity timelines=== Time magic features prominent as a chekhov's gun on several occasions. Discovered and/or invented by Starswirl, it allowed him to manipulate time and remain ageless. Because using it irresponsible could lead to branches in time or time loops, Celestia outlawed time magic, and all knowledge pertaining to it is held within Starswirl the Bearded Wing of the Canterlot Archives.It's About Time In "The Cutie Re-Mark", several alternate versions of Equestria are depicted as a result of Starlight Glimmer changing history. In the first alternate timeline shown, King Sombra expands the Crystal Empire's borders to cover half of Equestria and the Griffon Kingdom. In the second, Queen Chrysalis and the changelings have conquered Canterlot and forced many ponies into hiding. In the third, Nightmare Moon rules Equestria in eternal night after banishing Celestia to the moon. Further alternate realities include one ruled by Discord, one in which Tirek ravages the land, one in which Flim and Flam bulldoze the Everfree Forest for development, and one in which Equestria is reduced to a barren wasteland. Thanks to Twilight Sparkle's actions, these alternate realities are undone. ==Inhabitants== ===Ponies=== Ponies are sapient, quadrupedal, ungulate mammals. Distinguishable from other equine species by their facultative bipedalism, pastel coats/manes/tails, and the picturesque "cutie mark" that appears on their flanks when they find their "Special Talent"... their true purpose in life. The pony species can be further subdivided into six races: earth pony, pegasus pony, unicorn pony, crystal pony, thestral pony, and alicorn pony. Equestrian ponies are amongst of the most influential species in history--having established a powerful nation, Equestria, whose territories included much of the known world at the apex of their civilizations' existence. Other foreign nations known to have been established and/or inhabited by ponies include Saddle Arabia and Maretonia. ====Earth Ponies==== :Earth ponies possess an underlying connection to the earth, nature, and the environment that encourages the growth of plant life and a connection with wild animals. Earth pony based technology is purely mechanical and often is intended to replicate things they cannot do themselves. Earth ponies form the backbone of Equestria's economy, operating within most industries sectors involving natural resources, construction or extraction. Their natural talents in agriculture, forestry, and mining extends from plants to rock farms. Compared to pegasi and unicorns, earth ponies exhibit supernatural strength, stamina, fortitude, and durability. ====Pegasus Ponies==== :Pegasi have the unique ability to fly and magically control the weather. This ability is powered by a pair of feathered wings, which is the distinguishing anatomical feature of pegasi compared to other pony races. Pegasi make up the majority of ponies responsible for the postal service, patrolling Equestria's airspace, and controlling Equestria's weather. Pegasi are the only pony able to naturally interact with clouds as if they were tangible; this allows them to walk on and move clouds and, by extension, control the weather (although other pony types are able to due this through artificial means using magic). In the episode "Hurricane Fluttershy", a coordinated team of one hundred pegasi demonstrate their ability to generate hurricane-force winds to funnel water from a lake. ====Unicorn Ponies==== :Unicorns can directly absorb, wield, channel, create and manipulate magic; this ability is powered by a horn of variable length, texture, and color on their forehead. However, a unicorn's horn can be destroyed, taking away most of their magical capabilities. Unicorns are amongst the most educated and scholarly of Equestria's citizens. While other ponies' innate magical talents are "intuitive or instinctive", unicorns require decades of higher education to master any spell beyond the most basic fundamentals. Many spells and abilities are open to all unicorns, but many unicorn has a specialty, be it teleportation, transfiguration, or medicine. Generally, unicorns have a collection of various spells relating to their specialty, one being vastly more effective than the rest. ====Crystal Ponies==== :Crystal ponies are a glittery crystal version of the three tribes: earth ponies, pegasus ponies, and unicorn ponies. Crystal ponies have the same magics as their non-crystal counterparts. They also have the ability to assume a glittery crystal appearance when they are in a good mood. When they are in a sad mood they assume a dull, and bland, appearance. They also have the ability to use crystal magic. This gives the ability to infuse their emotions into crystal. And thus, empower the Crystal Heart when it is needed. ====Thestral Ponies==== :Thestral ponies are a subset of ponies. They are easily recognizable by their bat-like wings, and their slit-pupil eyes. ====Alicorn Ponies==== :The novel "Twilight Sparkle and the Crystal Heart Spell" establishes that the Alicorn Princesses are "a special breed of pony able to harness the magical powers of the Unicorns, the flight abilities of the Pegasi, and the strength of a good, true heart of an Earth Pony."Twilight Sparkle and the Crystal Heart Spell Faust states that Celestia "embodies the traits of all three [kinds of ponies]". Alicorns are a unique race of pony that possess all three distinguishing features of the other pony races: the horn of a unicorn, the wings of a pegasus, and the fortitude of an earth pony. As such, this also grants them access to the inherent magical abilities of all three races. They are taller and more slender than most ponies, and known for their unnaturally long lifespan and supernatural abilities. ===Non-ponies=== In addition to native ponies, Equestria is inhabited by a number of Non-ponies; while ponies make up the clear majority of the Equestrian population, several other sapient species, often ungulates like cattle or the Kirin, also live in Equestria. ====Zebras==== :Zebras are distinguishable by the unique black-and-white stripes that adorn their coats and the glyph-like Cutie Mark that adorns their haunch. Zebras are explicitly stated not to be a race of pony despite being the only other creature to feature a cutie mark. Zebras have been shown as naturally resistant to forms of mind control and cannot be detected by telepathic entities. There were a number of communities in Equestria that had zebras living and working among ponies, often as the minority. While zebra interaction with ponies was not uncommon, their strange mannerisms invited speculation and irrational fear among ponies in some areas. ====Dragons==== :Dragons are winged, serpentine omnivores and lithovores who possess strong armored scales and breathe magical fire as a form of attack. Aside from allegiance to the Dragon Lord, dragons had no real alignment nor organized society, and most merely roamed around the land, only occasionally being spotted within the borders of Equestria. Dragons are highly competitive and materialistic, known to grow in size as they collect or hoard things.Secret of My ExcessTriple ThreatShadow Play. ====Draconequus==== :Draconequus are beings of immense power, powerful enough to alter reality at a whim. Discord is the only example of a Draconequus within the main television series; however, he and others reference Draconequui as being a species, implying that there are more than one. The species is a dragon-like chimera made from the body parts of different animals. ==Government== Equestria is originally depicted as a semi-constitutional coregency, principality, eventually becoming a singular monarchy with the abdication of Princesses Celestia and Luna in favor of Princess Twilight Sparkle. Equestrian government, as described in depth by the comic and video game series, has a legislative branch, an executive branch, headed by four monarchs, and a judiciary branch, with judges appointed by region by the monarchs. The main television series, however, rarely delves into political detail on the government of Equestria--despite many principal characters being government officials--beyond its executive branch and the various political officials of the Ponyville and Canterlot townships. Governance within Equestria's principalities demonstrate an exceptionally high level of stability, organization and communication, even across so sprawling a continent-size domain through the use of extensive ships, railroads and highways, and a postal system of quick supply storehouses, rest stops, and relay stations. Deployment of soldiers, distribution of workers, and transmission of messages could be achieved with tremendous speeds, preventing what might otherwise be a crippling disconnect and disunity throughout the nation. ===Princesses of Equestria=== The government is currently as of the series finale a matriarchy-monarchy: concentration of sovereignty resides with the current alicorn sovereign princess Twilight Sparkle. Royal linage has been showed to be gained in both meritocratic and hereditary means, whereby some princess have earned their position through "alicorn ascendency" (such as Twilight Sparkle), which has been depicted only once in show canon, and only achievable via an act of unprecedented heroism, or the creation of "new magic". Other princesses however have been shown to inherit royal status from parents (such as Flurry Heart). Celestia and Luna act as the Heads of State and Government. The exact extent of the Princesses' powers and influence is unknown--other than constitutional limitations Celestia placed upon herself--as the separation of powers distribution between the government branches are never specified. ====Princess Celestia==== :Princess Celestia, the Princess of the Day, originally being the eldest monarch before her abdication and only monarch during a 1,000 year period after Princess Luna's deposition and banishment, often handles the affairs of state and diplomacy. Supreme Commander of armed forces in wartime."The Cutie Re-Mark" Celestia affected the role of the monarchy from her coronation to her abdication, and her history is inseparable and synonymous with Equestria's. From the beginning, Celestia despised tyranny and did not want to resemble a Queen or an Empress, nor be referred to as one. She preferred the title "Princess" as a sign of humility, which is how equestrian sovereigns are still addressed to this day. Celestia is the eldest of the two Royal Sisters, the longest-lived and longest-reigning Equestrian monarch--older than anyone would dare guess--acting as head ruler of Equestria for over one thousand years due to the timeless aging of alicorns. Additionally, she is responsible for the raising and lowering the sun, working in tandem with her sister Luna to ensure a night and day cycle. She is perhaps the most beloved creature in the world, being a staunch proponent for international peace, kindness and cooperation. Very little of her past before Celestia's victory over Discord is known, except that she and Luna discovered the Elements of Harmony. With these artifacts and their bearers, Princess Celestia has secured millennia-long, relative peace for a nation. ====Princess Luna==== :Princess Luna, the Princess of the Night and original diarch of Equestria before her abdication, utilizes her intimate knowledge of fear and the use of moon magic in her duties, monitoring the dreams of all creatures and protecting them from nightmares. ====Princess Cadance==== :Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, the Princess of Love, and her husband Prince consort Shining Armor jointly serve as the "Empress and Emperor of the Crystal Empire", which is a semi-autonomous territory of Equestria with its own military guard and unique culture. Cadence, young Pegasus mare and a distant relative of the lost Princess Amore, defeated a unicorn sorceress named Prismia. Her victory transported her to an unknown magical realm where she met Celestia, who adopted the newly ascended Alicorn as her niece. After the Crystal Empire returned and subsequent defeat of King Sombra, Cadence became the rightful ruler of the Empire. ====Princess Flurry Heart==== :Cadence gives birth to an alicorn filly named Flurry Heart. Celestia and Luna both stated that "the birth of an alicorn, is something Equestria has never seen", and that it was "even beyond their understanding"."The Crystalling" ====Princess Twilight Sparkle==== :Princess Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship, plays a de facto role similar to that of a Foreign Minister or Secretary of State, often acting as a diplomatic figure to other nations. She had been groomed by Celestia for leadership so that she could rule after Celestia's and Luna's eventual retirement. With the aid of her friends and the Tree of Harmony, Twilight has made it her life's mission to spread the magic of friendship across the known world. :Celestia's prized pupil, Twilight Sparkle, successfully completed a number of impressive tasks with the aid of her friends, the new wielders of the Elements of Harmony. After she redeemed Nightmare Moon, thwarted the return of Discord, and helped thwart Queen Chrysalis' takeover of Canterlot, she was tasked with helping safeguard the newly returned Crystal Empire. Upon her success, Celestia and Luna agreed that she was ready to face another challenge: finishing an incomplete spell of Starswirl's. After accidentally switching her friends' cutie marks, Twilight was able to restore them to normal and complete the spell. As a result, she created "new magic" and became an Alicorn, with Celestia acknowledging her as a princess. :Twilight establishes the joint ruleship of Equestria with the Council of Friendship--currently consisting of the Mane Six--which effectively serves as her cabinet; they gather once a moon to consult issues ranging from friendship problems to national security, while in doing so, removing the risk of having time spent apart weaken their friendship. ===Domestic defense=== Equestria is depicted as being a mostly peaceful nation that hasn't experienced war for centuries; aside from a few judicial warships and a core defense force, there was with little need for a large professional military beyond the existing Wonderbolts, who patrols Equestria's air space, and the Royal Guards that protect the Princesses. The previous Changeling Hive conflicts were asymmetrical; a "cold war" where neither belligerents could achieve decisive victory for their side. This state of relaxed peacetime security and vulnerability were recently exploited by the invading Storm Empire, followed by a terrorist attack by villains, which forced Equestria to update their defenses in response.Twilight's Seven Equestria first and foremost line of defence falls upon Princess Twilight Sparkle and the Mane 6, who are often called upon to defend Equestria against magical threats. An alternate timeline of the main series showed that the rulers of Equestria may choose to retain command of the armed forces when they are raised. ====E.U.P. Guard==== E.U.P. (Earth, Unicorn, Pegasi) Guard of Equestria was formally established in response for Equestria need for a modernized gendarmerie professional standing army and law enforcement on a federal administrative level. The E.U.P. guard were active around the time that the Pony of Shadows abducted Princess Celestia and Princess Luna.Legends of Magic Annual 2018 Under Twilight's rule the E.U.P. guard now includes non-ponies amongst their ranks. Prior to the formal establishment of the E.U.P. Guard, forerunners were decentralized fiefdoms of militias or mercenaries. Known military forces that defended various populations in Equestria have included the Cloudsdale Royal Legion and the Mighty Helm. Pre-Equestrian rulers were seen to maintain forces of "guardsponies", with Commander Hurricane and Sable Spirit both maintaining forces of Pegasi and Unicorn guards, respectively. ====Royal Guards==== The Royal Guards are the pony protectors of Princess Celestia, Princess Luna, Princess Cadance, and Princess Twilight Sparkle. The royal guard were in operation by the time Nightmare Moon began invading the dreams of ponies after turning the enslaved Nyx into the Nightmare Forces.Fiendship is Magic issue 4 The Royal Guard themselves have largely proven ceremonial: as any threat that the Alicorn Princesses would have needed protection from have consistently ripped through them--with the Princesses somehow protecting them--and are thus relegated to law enforcement and other mundane matters. After Flash Magnus became a drill sergeant for the guard, these guards-including some mares specified as serving under Princess LunaMy Little Pony (Gameloft game)-were more commonly seen. The current Royal Guardcommander is Shining Armor, Royal Captain of the Guards; Gallus is later promoted to that rank. ====Crystal Guard==== The Crystal GuardFiendship is Magic issue 1--an E.U.P. guard subdivision--have defended the Crystal Empire for an unknown period of time, dating back at least as far as King Sombra's childhood. Members include Crystal Pegasi, Crystal Earth Ponies, and Crystal Unicorns.Friends Forever issue 30 ====Night Guard==== The Night Guard--consisting of "Bat Ponies" aka "Thestral Ponies" --serve as Princess Luna's guards, though they have also been seen in the company of Princess Celestia; in an alternate timeline, several Bat Ponies served as Nightmare Moon's royal guards. ====Wonderbolts==== The Wonderbolts are an elite unit of Pegasi and serves as the air force division of the Royal Guards of Equestria. The Wonderbolts have a proud military tradition: on the anniversary of the First Celestial year of peace following Nightmare Moon's banishment, General Firefly selected a group of fliers from among the E.U.P. guard to perform at the Summer Sun Celebration. This group would later come to be known as the Wonderbolts. Under Twilight's rule the Wonderbolts now includes non-ponies amongst their ranks. The current Wonderbolt commander is Spitfire, Air Chief Marshal; Rainbow Dash is later promoted to that rank. ===National intelligence=== Internal existential threats necessitate priority for covert counterintelligence, internal security and anti-monster agencies. Sweetie Drops (Bon Bon) is the only known pony associated with such organizations. ===Foreign relations=== Equestria successfully continues, through the diplomatic efforts of Princess Twilight and her friends, to use soft power in forging cultural, political, diplomatic, military and economic cooperation with Griffonstone, Yakyakistan, Hippogriffia/Seaquestria, Maretonia, Saddle Arabia, the reformed Changeling Hive, and the Dragonlands. ==Culture== Culturally, Equestria is quite similar to the culture of the anglosphere, reflecting analogies with both the United States and Canada. The foundations of the culture were the principles of harmony, order and friendship; which helps maintain unity within the principalities through adherence culture and identity. Although Equestria encompasses several ethnic groups and cultures, the speedy means which information and orders can be moved throughout the principalities does demonstrate a high capability for maintaining peace and unity. ===Holidays, observances and events=== Specific events are depicted in the show. Some are regular annual occurrences; others happen more infrequently. ====Major events==== *Hearth's Warming and Hearth's Warming Eve: An annual holiday commemorating the Declaration of Hearth's Warming. The holiday tends to act as the national holiday of Equestria; however, the holiday's celebrations are nearly identical to Christmas, in that it is celebrated during winter and has similar traditions including decorating trees and exchanging gifts. *Crystal Faire: An annual public holiday held in honor of Princess Cadence within the Crystal Empire. It was established by the Crystal Ponies' first empress, Princess Amore, and became their most important tradition in "renew the spirit of love and unity in the Empire so the Crystal Ponies could protect Equestria from harm." *Festival of the Two Sisters: A public holiday, formerly known as the Summer Sun Celebration, originally held in honor of Princess Celestia as the longest day of the year. It formerly commemorated the anniversary of Princess Celestia's first raising of the sun, Celestia's battle to restore the sun to Equestria by imprisoning Nightmare Moon, and the redemption of Princess Luna; but is now meant to honor the two sisters. The event itself mostly takes place in Canterlot, and ends with Celestia raising the sun behind her. *Nightmare Night: A Halloween-like holiday held in honor of Princess Luna, in which foals dress up in costumes and go door-to-door collecting candy. Festival activities include a carnival with various games, musical entertainment, and a tradition in which candy is offered to the effigy of Nightmare Moon. According to myth, this holiday was meant to appease Nightmare Moon, lest she visit nightmares upon the innocent and devour naughty children. In "Luna Eclipsed", though initially disgusted in the celebration of subjecting her own people to fear, Twilight helped Luna learned to understand and even embrace this dark aspect of her persona. *Friendship Festival: An annual holiday held in honor of Twilight Sparkle. It is first depicted in My Little Pony: The Movie, where ponies from all over Equestria gather in Canterlot. ====Minor events==== *Cute-ceanera: A coming of age event celebrated by those who have recently gotten their cutie marks, both males and females. *Crystalling: A special ceremony for Crystal Empire newborns that culminates in making the Crystal Heart stronger than before. *Equestria Games: A sporting event that first appears in the season four episode of the same name. Ms. Harshwhinny is the head of the Equestria Games as well as the Games Inspector. Different years' announced hosts of the Equestria Games include Fillydelphia and the Crystal Empire. *Grand Galloping Gala: An annual royal ball held to celebrate the completion of Canterlot after Equestria was founded. It is attended primarily by the upper class elite: to attend this event, one must possess a golden ticket. *Hearts and Hooves Day: a Valentine's Day-themed holiday. *Sisterhooves Social: An annual event in which "sister" teams of two compete in various contests. According to Granny Smith, the Sisterhooves Social has a loose definition of what constitutes a "sister". Because of this, non-sister teams and male ponies are allowed to participate. *Winter Wrap Up: An annual event that involves clearing winter in preparation for spring. All ponies are assigned to one of three teams: weather, plants, or animals. Because Ponyville was founded by earth ponies, they change the seasons from winter to spring without using magic. Even after unicorns and pegasi started settling there, the tradition has continued. ===Economics and society=== Equestria is an egalitarian society with an educated, literate labor pool that has a market economy through which a wide variety of goods and services are bought and sold, both through the use of currency and the barter. Many of the stories depicted across all media focus on the performance of economic tasks: crop harvesting, production of baked goods, and the maintenance of the town. ===Technology and magic=== Equestrian magic is tightly integrated with Equestrian technology, with the formal study of magic forming a fundamental scientific branch. It is a natural part of the Equestrian world that may be harnessed for useful applications, and continues to influence and shape everyday life in Equestria. Many creatures possess inherent abilities that are magical in nature. Ponies in particular have been shown as having natural magic, each species has a magical trait or quality that are mostly unique to them. Magic aids the pegasi in weather modification, the Earth ponies in resource extraction and agriculture, and aids unicorns with scientific research and in creating useful items that benefit all ponies. Overall, the level of technology in Equestria varies between early-to-mid 20th century, being chiefly dependent on the population density and economic prosperity of any given settlement. Firearms and other gunpowder-based weaponry are unheard of and is seen as magical. Metallurgy is limited to forging and blacksmiths. Electricity and internal combustion are readily available to all but the most isolated communities. Simple machines such as pulleys and levers are widely used. Warfare, when it occurs, is mostly composed of human wave attacks and close quarters combat. All aspects of life are through machinery that supplements the natural talents of ponykind. Ideas and concepts such as metallurgy, industrialization, mechanization, interchangeable parts, standardization of production, assembly lines, etc., are both known and depicted throughout every My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic media platform. Mass production on a large scale is available and inexpensive. Natural resources for production such as ores, lumber, textiles, petroleum and other sources, exist in abundance, with the methods of gathering and processing these resources being fast and efficient by Earth Ponies skilled in manual work. Postal service, travel, transport, and communication is relatively fast and efficient despite lacking advanced telecommunication; being limited to walking, flying, carriages, railroads, ships, and word of mouth. Teleportation, while widely known, is an advanced technique beyond most unicorns' ability to execute, and too physically exhausting to be viable. While the Princesses themselves, in effect, have access to "magical Email" (via Spike's flame) this ability is not depicted as readily available or widespread. Medical technology is advanced and sanitary, with modern hospital facilities--staffed by trained medical professionals--being further supplemented with healing magic. In terms of maritime technology, ships varies from oar and sail in terms of propulsion to advanced steamships with paddle-wheel or screw propellers. Advanced radar, sonar, or GPS are unknown; depiction of navigation is done by the stars and primitive maps and other navigational equipment. Advancements in the sciences Equestria have achieved has taken decades or even centuries to discover. Magic in Equestria is highly developed as science, causing many useful applications ranging from industries, to combat and civilian applications. Rural or isolated communities products' are hand- crafted by specialists and therefore time-consuming to create. Due to the huge gap in technology level when compared to Equestria, the military, economy and overall standard of living is exceedingly primitive for other nations depicted throughout the franchise. In comparison to Dragonkind's culture, for example, the resulting stagnation of technological advance is enormous. This abundance of magical technological progress is due largely in part to Equestria's compulsory education system and actual scientific research. By opening Equestria's schools, Twilight hopes to share in Equestria's prosperity gained through knowledge and friendship with the non-pony nations throughout the known world. Chancellor Neighsay and other decouncers cited unsegregated inclusiveness of non-pony creatures as a naive foolish act that inevitably threatens Equestria's national security. ====Infrastructure and Industrialization==== Equestria is depicted as being a heavily Tier 2 industrialization, with access to early-to-mid 20th century pre-digital technology. Commonly depicted technologies include hard fantasy/steampunk- style steam locomotive rapid transits, zeppelin airships, pegasi-powered commercial passenger aircraft, concrete-steel skyscrapers, analog computers and electric lighting. *Friendship Express is a transcontinental railroad used by Equestrians to travel between regions or continents within days, and is the main character's preferred method of traveling throughout Equestria. Steam- powered technology opened regions of Equestria to exploration and settlements that would not otherwise have been feasible, and forms the backbones of cross- country passenger and freight transportation networks. Since season two, the pink engine-powered train has appeared in the main title sequence; outside of the title sequence, the Friendship Express appears in dozens of episodes and the comics. *Airships - In "Apple Family Reunion", family members are seen using airships to travel. In "Once Upon a Zeppelin", Twilight Sparkle and her family win a free cruise, which turns out to be a themed vacation experience organized by Iron Will. However, airship technology is not exclusive to Equestria: the Storm King had a fleet of airships, and Capper mentions owning one to Twilight Sparkle. ====Sciences of Magic==== The limitations of magic are always explained even if the reason why is unexplained or impossible. Princess Twilight Sparkle frequently researches magic phenomena using the scientific method. *Cutie Marks - One distinctive form of natural magic shared by all ponies are Cutie Marks. Two marks appear, one on each flank, when a pony realizes their special talent or goal in life. *Spellcasting - Raw magic channeled by unicorns and alicorns can generate spells to cause specific effects, producing a colorful aura identical to the pony's eye color and/or cutie marks. ====Equestrian Artifacts==== Throughout Equestrian history, an unspecified number of magical objects have been imbued with quite the range of mystical powers by the greatest mages that came before. In the Equestria Girls franchise, some of these artifacts were discovered in the "Human World"; a recurring plot element involves Sunset Shimmer and their friends tracking them down and/or removing them from the possession of humans corrupted by their magic. *Elements of Harmony - Six magical artifacts created by the Tree of Harmony which, in turn, was created through the efforts of the Pillars of Old Equestria--and formerly wielded by Celestia and Luna--are the most powerful weapons in all of Equestria. They are gems that are depicted to be able to project rainbows powered by Friendship magic. They were used to defeat Nightmare Moon, and a thousand years later to restore her to her original form. The first five Elements were shaped like regular gems; a thousand years later, they all became shaped to resemble the cutie marks of their most recent bearers and placed in necklaces. The sixth Element, the Element of Magic, is shaped like a six-pointed star resembling the cutie mark of Twilight Sparkle, and a thousand years later is placed in a crown. The Elements of Harmony were returned to Tree of Harmony in "Princess Twilight Sparkle" so the Tree of Harmony could prevent the Everfree Forest from growing out of control. The Elements and the Tree of Harmony were destroyed in "The Beginning of the End", but it has been shown that the Mane Six are still able to harness their power despite them being destroyed. *Crystal Heart - A magical heart-shaped crystal that the Crystal Ponies use to protect the Crystal Empire. It is powered by Love magic and is featured in the cutie mark of Princess Cadance and Princess Amore. *Crystal Mirror - A mirror created by Star Swirl that acts as a portal to the human world. Twilight Sparkle, Sunset Shimmer, and Spike use it to travel between Equestria and the human world when necessary. *Alicorn Amulet - A magical amulet featured in the episode "Magic Duel". The amulet is designed to enhance an alicorn's magic; a non-alicorn who uses the amulet risks being corrupted. It has a built-in magical lock that prevents any pony other than the bearer from taking it off. *Cutie Map - A magical map of Equestria first seen in "The Cutie Map". Twilight Sparkle and her friends use it to solve friendship problems across Equestria. *Mirror Pool - An enchanted pool in the Everfree Forest that can duplicate whoever stands in front of it. *Time Twirler - A stopwatch artifact of Starswirl's invention seen in Equestria Girls; when activated, has the power to loop time. *Staff of Sacanas - A legendary staff first seen in My Little Pony: The Movie and used by Storm King and Princess Eris. The staff's primary function appears to be that of power absorption and amplify it to unprecedented heights. The Staff of Sacanas was wielded by the Storm King among several of his earlier conquests, using it to sack over a dozen kingdoms, and to destroy a dozen more. Under the Storm Kings ownership, it could control the weather, due to having absorbed the power of a member of Strife's species and could later control the sun and moon with the power of the Princesses of Equestria's magic. In an alternate universe, Princess Eris received the staff as well: she managed to absorb the powers of Princess Luna and claimed it could affect dreams as well and would sell the staff at an auction, allowing whatever villain who wanted it to do whatever they wished with it. *Grogar's Bell - A bewitching bell created by the evil ram Grogar. He was the emperor of the land before the founding of Equestia (the land as it's known today was only a mere field of land and pastures) until the renowned Gusty the Great stole his bewitching well, and securely placing it at the peak of Mount Everhoof. The mountain is protected by an ancient spell and magical winds to prevent the bell from being taken. The bell allows the user to cast a spell and take the magical power of any earth pony, unicorn or pegasi, and the bell stores this magic until it is released. The bell cannot be destroyed. *The Cloak of Clover the Clever - A magical artifact that was used to drain all of the magic out of Equestria, along with five other magical artifacts. ===Flora and Fauna=== Much of the flora and fauna of Equestria is similar or practically identical to those on Earth, among the species shown or referenced include cats, dogs, rabbits, snakes, vultures, and numerous plant species such as trees or grasses. In addition to those species similar to those on Earth, there are a number of typical "fantasy" species. ====Magical creatures==== Magical creatures in the show include but are not limited to: *Dragons - Dragons in the show exhibit varying levels of sapience and intelligence. Some, like Spike, integrated into pony culture, while others, like the oversized and more traditionally designed Razer resemble a more beastly creature. Dragons breathe fire, eat gemstones, and are generally speaking aggressive. *Griffons - a mythical creature with the head and wings of an eagle and the body of a lion, depicted in the show as aggressive and, with few exceptions, as enemies to Equestria. They reside in Griffonstone. *Changelings - Changelings appear equine in nature and share many physical characteristics with ponies. The differences are drastic, however, in that they possess an exoskeleton similar to an insect and are capable via dark magic of changing their forms into any creature they desire at will. Up until the later seasons of the show, they were depicted as enemies of Equestria. They are the children of Queen Chrysalis, who acts as the hive mother. *Deer - Deer are depicted as mysterious residents of the Everfree Forest. Little is known about them other than that they share a connection to the forestry and surrounding wilderness. *Gargoyles - Creatures with a dragon-like body, bat- like wings, a long neck, and the ability to breathe fire. *Demon - Any creature that has allowed themselves to be consumed by dark magic, transforming them into a creature with reddened skin and horns. *Cyclops - Giant, bipedal goatmen with a large singular eye. *Chimera - a monstrous fire- breathing creature with the body and head of a sabertooth tiger, a goat's head rising from its back, and the front part of a snake as a tail. *Cerberus - A giant three-headed dog that guards Tartarus, a realm of eternal imprisonment. *Centaur - Demon-like creatures with a humanoid upper body and equine lower body. Centaurs are depicted in the show as being obsessed with consuming the magic of others. *Manticores - Monsters with the head and body of a lion, a pair of bat wings growing from their backs and the stinger of a scorpion. ==Geography== Equestria is the largest equine nation, stretching across a peninsula-continent that touches both the northern arctic and subarctic poles; located on an Earth-like planet which, within the Friendship is Magic television series, has not been specifically named. Equestria reaches from the western Luna Ocean to the eastern Celestia Sea, bordering the northern Crystal Empire and the southern Queendom of Changlings. The Equestrian continent's diverse geography ranges, biomes, provinces and settlements are modeled after or based on North American cities and the nearctic realm. The full geography of the Equestria is currently unexplored and evolving to fit the needs of the show writers, and is currently limited to a part of the continent of Equus (the Equestrian continent), which is controlled mostly by the Equestrian nation. The Equestrian-explored portion of the continent is flanked by two vast oceans, bounded to the north by the mountainous Frozen North region and extends across the northern and southern hemispheres, ending with the Bone Dry Desert that borders the Mysterious South region. However, a map included in the Friendship Is Magic film indicates vast areas beyond these regions.My Little Pony: The Movie The exact size or chronology of the planet is unknown. Like Earth, Equestria's world has one moon, and is depicted as being part of a solar system that includes at least four more planets. Questions regarding heliocentrism or geocentrism are complicated by the fact that Celestia and Luna can move the Sun and Moon, respectively, at a mere whim. Similar constellations exist; with the caveat that most of them are also dangerous monsters, such as Canis Major and Ursa Minor. In relation to the "Human World"My Little Pony:Equestria Girls its not clear if Equestria is located in a parallel universe, or somewhere in the same universe as Earth. Uncertainty about this fact also makes it difficult to determine if the Equestrian events are occurring at the same time as events on Earth, or if the entire world exists in Earth's relative past or future, with the "Magic Mirror" acting as a portal through time, rather than just space. Notable settlements, territories, dependencies and major population centers in Equestria are identified throughout the series and used as the setting for one or more episodes. Most minor locations, or vaguely referenced areas outside Equestria, both in the television series and associated media aren't specified whether these locations are part of Equestria or not. The films, television series, and other franchise media take place in many locations and their exact affiliation with Equestria is not explored. As the creator of the show wrote, Lauren Faust explained on various social media pages, that the Everfree Forest is west of Ponyville, Sweet Apple Acres is southwest, and both Fluttershy's cottage and meadow are located north of the farm, presumably between Ponyville and the forest. Canterlot is northeast of Ponyville. However, in subsequent interviews, both Faust and Jayson Thiessen mentioned that the geography and continuity of the show are fluidly defined and are subject to change as necessary, and that the production team had no official map of Equestria at their disposal. ===Capital Region=== The Capital Region is Equestria's foundation and "ancestral lands", where the united cooperation between the unicorns, pegasi, and earth ponies brought an end to Eternal Winter. The Capital Region represents Equestria's original sovereign borders before the dynastic reign of Princess Celestia; all outlying territories represent subsequent thousand year expansion of the nation's imperialist interests. Much of the Capital Regions are "crown lands"; i.e. they are legally considered public land and is apart from the monarch's private estate. ==== Ponyville ==== Ponyville is the main setting of the entire My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic media franchise, and primary home to the Mane 6. The current elected administrator is Mayor Mare has been leading Ponyville for at least a decade. Ponyville is a young agrarian society settlement, founded a century ago by earth ponies of the Apple family on crown lands lands granted by Princess Celestia personally. A population exceeding a thousand, Ponyville's residents are mostly earth ponies with, though a fair number of pegasi (at least 100 approx.)Hurricane Fluttershy and several dozen unicorns, and some non-ponies call it home. Ponyville is known for its agricultural produce--apples, pears, carrots, etc.--and is home of "Sweet Apple Acres", Equestria's only source of domesticated zap apple jam. Ponyville has accommodations normally reserved for larger settlements; it is a school district, a diplomatic mission, a tourist destination and a rail center--being the first/last connecting stop between Canterlot and other principalities--but Ponyville has long prided itself on its earth pony culture and its avoidance of urbanization. Ponyville's "old- fashioned charm" atmosphere is misleading: the small town is home to a diverse cast of eccentric ponies--from grand parties hosted by Pinkie Pie, to Rarity's world renown fashions shows, too name a few--and not a single week passes without some grand adventure or crisis of sort requiring the immediate attention of its residences. Twilight's own first impression of Ponyville upon first arrival was "Everypony in this town is crazy!"Friendship is Magic Ponyville is portrayed on the world map as a small village near the center of Equestria, within visual distance of both Canterlot and Cloudsdale. The design of Ponyville is mostly Bavarian, with a minor influence of Americana. The season 4 finale, "Twilight's Kingdom", introduces the Castle of Friendship in Ponyville as the residence of Twilight Sparkle, her assistant Spike, and her pupil Starlight Glimmer. According to the book Art of Equestria, which describes the creation of Friendship is Magic, the creator of the series, Lauren Faust, originally proposed the name Fillydelphia (a pun on the city of Philadelphia) instead of Ponyville. The series later added Fillydelphia as a new, separate city. Faust wrote in a comment on her DeviantArt page that the Everfree Forest is west of Ponyville, Sweet Apple Acres is southwest, Canterlot is northeast, and Fluttershy's cottage and meadow are located north of the farm. However, in subsequent interviews, both Faust and the supervising director and executive producer of the series, Jayson Thiessen, mentioned that the geography and continuity of the show are loosely defined and may change as necessary, and a layout artist for the series stated on December 10, 2011, that the production team had no official map of Equestria for reference. Image archived. Upon the release of Art of Equestria, however, an official map was released. It suggests that the Everfree Forest is to the east of Ponyville, Sweet Apple Acres to the southeast, and Fluttershy's cottage and meadow are located north of the farm. ==== Canterlot ==== The Kingdom of Canterlot is the capital of Equestria, built on the side of the Foal Mountains. Canterlot is the setting of the royal court of Princess Celestia and Luna and the residence of Twilight Sparkle before Ponyville. Canterlot Castle is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It has been a focal point for the Equestrian people at times of national rejoicing and mourning. The name Canterlot is a portmanteau of Camelot and canter. Lauren Faust's inspiration for Canterlot, with its castle carved into the side of the mountain, was Minas Tirith from The Lord of the Rings. Ted Anderson and Agnes Garbowska's inspiration for ancient Canterlot was ancient Rome. According to Lauren Faust, Canterlot was originally called "Canterbury", after the historical English city, and the name "Canterlot" was suggested by her husband Craig McCracken. ====Cloudsdale==== Cloudsdale is a large floating city in Equestria first depicted in "Sonic Rainboom". Depicted as being within central capitol region proper, relatively near to Ponyville and Canterlot. Unlike other cities, Cloudsdale floats on a series of clouds, and is only accessible by winged creatures and creatures that have had a "cloud-walking spell" cast upon them. It is the largest known Pegasi settlement in the realm. Cloudsdale is said to be the original home and birthplace of Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy. Cloudsdale served as the backdrop in the episodes: "The Cutie Mark Chronicles", "The Return of Harmony", "Hurricane Fluttershy", "Tanks for the Memories", and "The End of the End". In Friendship Games, Cloudsdale appears in one of the dimensional rifts opened by Midnight Sparkle. Cloudsdale is a pun on Clydesdale, a breed of horse; according to Lauren Faust, the name "Cloudsdale" was originally suggested by her husband Craig McCracken. ==== Everfree Forest ==== The Everfree Forest is a large, enchanted forest grove in the boundaries adjacent of the Ponyville township; it is usually referred to simply as "the Forest". While technically part of Equestria, the Everfree Forest seasons have a will of their own there. The Forest is also home to an assortment of creatures, many of them dangerous; the animals take care of themselves and are truly wild; and terrible legendary monsters stalk the shadows. Among the plant species within the Forest are trees such as beech, oak, pine, sycamore, yew and knotgrass and thorn undergrowth. Though the Forest is vastly dense and wild, there are few paths and clearings due to the mutated vegetation that grow fast and wild. It is noted as being one of the few places in Equestria where magic behaves erratically for unicorns, the land cannot be tamed by the earth ponies, nor the weather be controlled by the pegasi, but instead moves on its own. The Pillars planted the Tree of Harmony here, both to keep the plethora of monsters and vegetations in check, and to utilize the hostile environment as natural protection from any who would seek out the Tree. The forest is considered uninhabitable and regarded by ponies as the most hostile region within Equestria's borders. Travel is strictly prohibited to all Equestrians for their personal safety. Only the native Everfree Deers seem capable of calling this environment home. It is the location of the Castle of Two Sisters, the Mirror Pool, and other enchanted phenomena. Due to the forest's rich biodiversity of flora and fauna, Zecora frequently travels into the Forest for various reasons; she built her hut within to more easily harvest ingredients for her potions. Thicket, a Deer village, is surrounded by Everfree's thick forests and steep hills which create an enclave that is cut off from its immediate hinterland. Thicket exercises tribal sovereignty--complete jurisdiction and control over the Everfree Forest territory--while recognizing that Equestria retains ultimate federal sovereignty. The episode "Stare Master" states that the forest is filled with "many strange creatures". Subsequent episodes show that creatures from the Everfree Forest include hydras, manticores, Cragadiles (crocodile-like creatures made of stone), Timber Wolves (huge wolves made of tree trunks), sea serpents, cockatrices, Parasprites (small bug-like creatures that are highly destructive, but regarded as cute), and Ursas (large bear-like creatures with enlarged teeth and blue or purple fur). ===Frozen North=== The Frozen North is dominated by the Yaket Mountain Range, north of Equestria, and characterized by an alpine climate, subarctic montane ecosystems, and polar climate. It is a setting in the IDW comic My Little Pony: Friends Forever issue 36. It has short cool summers and long cold winters, and biomes consisting of taiga, treeless tundra, glaciers, exotic medicinal plants, and permanent ice sheets. ==== Crystal Empire ==== The Crystal Empire is introduced in season three's premiere episode. It was founded Princess Amore, a female unicorn who appears in the IDW comics' "My Little Pony: FIENDship is Magic Issue #1" and whose name appears in Little, Brown and Company's "The Journal of the Two Sisters". The Crystal Empire is a non-sovereign monarchy and technically the oldest of Equestria's principalities; its existence predates it by centuries. After the conflict instigated by King Sombra, the capital vanished fom existence and the empire was annexed by Equestria. The Crystal Heart is the empire's most sacred magical artifact, which possesses the power to absorb, magnify, and deflect emotions. The crystal ponies used it in peacetime to exponentially amplify the power of love and project hope and love across Equestria. In times of conflict, it can be used as a weapon to demoralize the armies of would be aggressors. Celestia addresses the Crystal Empire as a sister nation that is part of Equestria, and the crystal ponies refer to themselves as Equestrian. In "The Ballad of the Crystal Empire", Twilight Sparkle mentions the Crystal Kingdom as part of the Crystal Ponies' history. It is also home to the Crystal Ponies as well as prince regent Shining Armor and princess regnant Mi Amore Cadenza, who took over the kingdom after King Sombra was defeated a second time by the Crystal Heart. Royal Magic Advisor Sunburst serves her majesty as "Royal Mentor and Foalsitter" to their daughter and royal heir, Princess Flurry Heart. The book "Twilight Sparkle and the Crystal Heart Spell" names the Crystal Empire as part of Equestria. ===Celestial Coast=== The Celestia Sea is located east of Equestria, and is analogous to the real world Atlantic Ocean. The region's biomes, climate, and geographic terrain are equally analogous to Eastern Canada and Eastern United States. The coastline is an emerging megaregion and the most heavily urbanized agglomeration of Equestria. Across the sea, to the far east lies the Griffon Continent; notable nations include Griffonstone, the Griffish Isles, Bug Bear Territory, the Lands of the Hippogriffs, and the Lands of the Dragon. ==== Manehattan ==== Manehattan is based on the archipelago of Manhattan and Long Island, portrayed as a large port metropolis, with many landmarks resembling those from New York City. It is first depicted in "The Cutie Mark Chronicles" and featured prominently in "Rarity Takes Manehattan". It features late 20th century technologies; including tall buildings and skyscrapers with asphalt streets decorated with electric jumbotrons, neon signs, and lampposts."Shadow Play" Ponies' primary form of transportation are pony-drawn taxi carriages and underground metrorailway system. Manehattan is the most densely populated and ethnically diverse city in Equestria, hosting all manner of races and species, and is a major commercial, financial and cultural center. Its iconic landmarks include the Crystaller Building, Friendship Trade Center, neon-lit Bridleway Theater District, Madisoat Mare Garden, Maneway Grand Central Station, and Manehattan Park. A mirror of the Statue of Liberty, the "Mare Statue," located on Friendship Island, has become a national symbol of Equestria's commitment of peace and goodwill towards all nations. Like Ponyville and Canterlot, Manehattan is depicted as the location of one of Rarity's boutiques, known as "Rarity for You". Notable features of the setting include conventions differing from Ponyville's, as seen in the episode, "Stranger Than Fan Fiction", and an elevated train. Starlight's Village, also called Our Town, is a community in the Manehattan region and is characterized by a semi-arid climate. ==== Hollow Shades ==== Hollow Shades was first mentioned in "Apple Family Reunion". The town first physically appeared in the Map of Equestria, a hand-drawn piece of artwork that lays out the canonical layout of Equestria, located east of Canterlot, tucked underneath a forest canopy, and hidden behind Foal Mountain. ==== Seaward Shoals ==== Seaward Shoals is portrayed as a small rocky coastal port town, similar to those of the New England region of the United States. Also called Silver Shoals or Rocky Shoals, the community is the setting of the episode "P.P.O.V. (Pony Point of View)". The former Princesses, Luna and Celestia, retired to this region upon abdicating the throne.The End of the End ==== Griffish Isles ==== Griffish Isles, an Equestrian archipelago commonwealth, located in the Celestia Sea off the north-western coast of continental "Griffon continent", and is analogous to the real world British Isles. On the official mapMy Little Pony: The Movie, it is also very close to the Bug Bear Territory. Equestrian settlements include Buckingham, Manechester, and Trottingham (a portmanteau of 'Nottingham', an English city, and 'trot', a jogging speed for horses) the regional capitol city of Griffish Isles. The Griffish Isles is first mentioned in "Stare Master"--where Rarity is making 20 gold-lined gowns for ponies there--and later mentioned in "Luna Eclipsed" My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic Issue #15, "Simple Ways" My Little Pony: FIENDship is Magic Issue #3, and "Crusaders of the Lost Mark". It is also mentioned on Enterplay trading card series 2 #46, a card of Sir Lintsalot. Trottingham itself is said to be based on the British city of Birmingham and the ponies that inhabit it wear clothing inspired by British culture and have stereotype Cockney accents. Notable residents of Griffish Isles include Pipsqueak before a move, and Sassy Saddles before moving to the Equestrian mainland. ===Luna Coast=== ==== Las Pegasus ==== Las Pegasus is depicted as a floating cloud city, like Cloudsdale. Based on the cities of Las Vegas and Paradise, Nevada, Las Pegasus is portrayed as "one big party", with many hotels, resorts, nightlife, amusement parks, restaurants, arcades, and casinos. Las Pegasus was the setting of the episode "Viva Las Pegasus". Las Pegasus actively competes with Applewood and Manehatten for the title of "entertainment capitol of the world". ===Mysterious South=== This region is known for its arid deserts, temperate prairies and tropical rainforest biomes. Appleloosa Appleloosa is the most populous settlement in the region. Dodge Junction is based on the cities of the American Wild West, and is portrayed as a bustling township that mainly revolves around a cherry farm run by the earth pony Cherry Jubilee. Similar to Dodge Junction, Appleloosa, a pun of the Appaloosa horse breed, is a setting based on the cities of the American Wild West and mainly revolves around an apple orchard that is home to members of the "Apple Family". Appleloosa is depicted as bordering on the buffalo lands, home of the indigenous buffalo tribes. ==== The Badlands ==== The Badlands are in the remote desert backcountry, and are known to be populated by terrifying creatures, such as diamond dogs, giant worms, and rogue dragons. ==== Somnambula ==== Somnambula, roughly based on Egypt and North Africa, has an arid, desert climate, excluding a few oases. It is notable as a city that the pony adventurer Daring Do has saved twice. Somnambula, a heroic pegasus who rescued the prince of the Kingdom from a sphinx, is the city's namesake. The city is noted as once being ruled over by pharaohs, and is first mentioned in the episode "Stranger than Fan Fiction", and shown again in the episode "Daring Done?". === Other locations === ====Hope Hollow==== Hope Hollow is a township located in an unspecified region of Equestria. It was primarily lead by the Skies family, who served as the mayors for at least three generations. Petunia Petals runs at least two businesses in the town, and assists the Mayor in fulfilling seven government jobs in total, making her arguably the most important pony in the town.My Little Pony: Rainbow Roadtrip ====Mentioned locations==== The setting of San Franciscolt is based on the city of San Francisco, and is mentioned in the book Twilight Sparkle and the Crystal Heart Spell. In episodes throughout the series and in promotional material, other locations are mentioned, but not used as settings. A partial list includes Baltimare, based on the city of Baltimore; Fillydelphia, which is based on the city of Philadelphia and was the original name for Ponyville when the show was in development; and Vanhoover, which is based on Vancouver, Canada and is described as the former home of "Grand Pear", Applejack's grandfather. ==Lands beyond Equestria== Most of these nations maintain some form of official diplomatic relations with Equestria. In Season 8 premier, Equestria's allied leadership sent their children to Princess Twilight's School of Friendship as part of a cultural exchange program; when the children went missing, their parents were prepared to declare war on Equestria. After the defeat of the Storm King, at the request of Twilight Sparkle, Equestria initiated economic assistance to help rebuild war-torn regions, remove trade barriers, modernize industry, and improve the prosperity of nations devastated by the Storm Empire. In "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic Issue #61-62" story Convocation of Creatures, Twilight Sparkle, Princess Celestia, and Raven Inkwell take part in the Convocation of Creatures, an assembly of delegates and leaders from all across the world. At the convocation reception, she meets Princess Cadance, Queen Novo, Princess Ember, Prince Rutherford, King Thorax, and hundreds of other leaders from other regions of the world. ===Allied Nations of Equestria=== ======== Saddle Arabia is mentioned in "Magic Duel", "Road to Friendship", and My Little Pony: The Movie. Princess Celestia has hosted diplomatic representatives from this region on several occasions. Hoo'Far, a Saddle Arabian unicorn, states that Saddle Arabia has "many fans" of Trixie. The name is a play on the country of Saudi Arabia. ======== The duke and duchess of Maretonia appear in attendance of the Equestria Games in the episode of the same name. They appear again in Twilight's Kingdom and visit the Crystal Empire for a summit with Celestia, Luna, and Cadance. Maretonia is also mentioned in Princess Celestia and the Summer of Royal Waves and by Cadance and Shining Armor in The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows. The name is a play on Macedonia. ======== The Hippogriffs/Hippocampus nation in My Little Pony The Movie and in The Official Movie Sourcebook, to which they fled after their original home of Hippogriffia was destroyed by the Storm King's forces. *: The location of the Hippogriff Kingdom, south of the Badlands, and located near Klugetown. Mount Aris also appears in "Surf and/or Turf" and is illustrated in "The Hearth's Warming Club" and "Father Knows Beast". *: The capital of the hippogriff kingdom, located atop Mount Aris. When Tempest Shadow infiltrates the city in an attempt to steal a magical pearl from Queen Novo, the city is destroyed in a battle between the Hippogriffs and the Storm King's forces, and is abandoned when the hippogriffs go into hiding. In the film, Twilight and her friends travel to the ruined city in search of the Hippogriffs. Hippogriffia also appears in "Surf and/or Turf", restored to its former glory. ======== The Changeling Hive is the home of the changelings. Here, Chrysalis is dethroned and Thorax succeeds her as changeling leader. The changelings fed on emotions, and their magic was built around them. ======== Dragon Lands are the home of dragons. Due to their egotistical nature, dragons do not have any formal borders or government by traditional definitions, functioning rather like adhocracy. Dragon's primary food source is that of gemstones, many of which are imported from Equestria. Since the rise of the new "Dragon Lord," the leader of the dragons, the dragons have agreed to "stop being bullies" to the ponies, and have even sent some members of their species to study in Equestria. ======== The Griffon Kingdom is primarily populated by griffons, and has acted as close allies of Equestria. * is the capitol city populated by griffons. It has a rich history centered around an ancient treasure called the Idol of Boreas. As with dragons, Griffin culture is one of "every Griffon for themselves" that places value upon personal honor and wealth. Griffons are taught to bolster themselves against this hostile environments, and any display of feelings is interpreted as weakness deserving of ridicule or exploitation. ======== Yakyakistan is the yak kingdom. It is located north of the Crystal Empire and is ruled by the yak Prince Rutherford. Ambassador Pinkie Pie befriended the citizens, was made an "honorary yak-pony", and assimilated into their culture. Prince Blueblood and Shining Armor visit Yakyakistan for a diplomatic mission to set up a trade agreement between it and the Crystal Empire. ======== AbyssiniaTails of Equestria: The Official Movie Sourcebook is a kingdom located in the Mysterious South, south of Equestria by the Bone Dry Desert. A fairly industrious kingdom, Abyssinia has numerous cities within its borders, such as the capital city of Panthera, Tabbytown and Henry. It's a largely peaceful kingdom with kind monarchs and well-developed cities and appears to be in many ways, the cat "equivalent" of Equestria. Abyssinia is named after the real-life cat breed. The location was first mentioned in "Ponies of Dark Water" in 2016 and made its first true appearance in "Storm King". Ever since then, the location has become a consistent aspect of the My Little Pony mythos, with it being mentioned in Tails of Equestria: The Official Movie Sourcebook, Ponyville Mysteries and the Gameloft video game. The early history of Abyssinia is quite vague. The land was ruled by an absolute monarchy of King and Queen, rather than Equestria's principality-like constitutional monarchy. Its capital of Panthera was settled on the borders of a cat-like lake by the Cat lords. Applejack and the Mane Six apparently have a history of getting arrested in Abyssinia, with Applejack claiming it was "strangely litigious". The kingdom was annexed by the Storm Empire: its capital of Panthera was later destroyed by the Storm King "out of boredom".My Little Pony: The Movie Prequel #3 During the Reign of the Storm King, many cats who left Panthera moved to Klugetown and set up various merchant shop and smuggling rings. After the Storm King was destroyed by the Mane Six, the kingdom's fate was left unknown. Afterwards, the Royal family of Abyssinia attended the "Convocation of the Creatures" event at Mount Metazoa, and the Abyssinian Embassy was constructed in Ponyville. These events signified that the kingdom is recovering from the disaster and is in diplomatic relations with Equestria. In the original map of Abyssinia, the continent was shown to be huge and vaguely L-shaped with mountainous terrain. After the release of My Little Pony: The Movie, the official location of the kingdom is currently unknown, given the known geography is mismatched with the layout of the Mysterious South. The kingdom appears to be mostly an even- temperament with large bodies of water and a decent amount of vegetation, but nearby locations such as Klugetown and the Basalt Beach are almost completely barren and dry. ===Other nations=== *Klugetown is a diversely-populated desert town featured in My Little Pony: The Movie, The Stormy Road to Canterlot, My Little Pony: The Movie Prequel Issue #4, Gameloft's mobile game, The Official Movie Sourcebook, and IDW's Nightmare Knights issue 4. Economically, Klugetown is depicted as being very close to a laissez-faire guildocracy, with little discipline or regulation governing trade or government, with both benign and sinister consequences. Although Klugetown tends to be lopped in with Abyssinia, Chummer remarked that the Bone Dry Desert, which surrounds all of Klugetown, was outside of Abyssinia's sovereign borders. ==Notes== * * * ==References== Category:My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic Category:Fictional elements introduced in 2010 Category:Fictional countries in other worlds Category: Fictional planets Category:Fictional principalities Category:Mythopoeia Category:My Little Pony articles needing photos
