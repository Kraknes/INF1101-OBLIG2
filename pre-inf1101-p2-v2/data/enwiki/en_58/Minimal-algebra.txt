Minimal algebra is an important concept in tame congruence theory, a theory that has been developed by Ralph McKenzie and David Hobby . ==Definition== A minimal algebra is a finite algebra with more than one element, in which every non-constant unary polynomial is a permutation on its domain. ==Classification== A polynomial of an algebra is a composition of its basic operations, 0-ary operations and the projections. Two algebras are called polynomially equivalent if they have the same universe and precisely the same polynomial operations. A minimal algebra \mathbb M falls into one of the following types (P. P. Palfy) * \mathbb M is of type \bf 1, or unary type, iff {\rm Pol} ~\mathbb M={\rm Pol} \langle M,G\rangle, where M denotes the universe of \mathbb M , \rm Pol~ \mathbb A denotes the set of all polynomials of an algebra \mathbb A and G is a subgroup of the symmetric group over M . * \mathbb M is of type \bf 2 , or affine type, iff \mathbb M is polynomially equivalent to a vector space. * \mathbb M is of type \bf 3, or Boolean type, iff \mathbb M is polynomially equivalent to a two-element Boolean algebra. * \mathbb M is of type \bf 4 , or lattice type, iff \mathbb M is polynomially equivalent to a two-element lattice. * \mathbb M is of type \bf 5, or semilattice type, iff \mathbb M is polynomially equivalent to a two- element semilattice. ==References== Category:Algebra
