The Earl of Eldon The Eldon Law Scholarship is a scholarship awarded to students from the University of Oxford who wish to study for the English Bar. Applicants must either have obtained a first class honours degree in the Final Honours School, or obtained a distinction on the BCL or MJur. It is a two-year scholarship presently funded at PS9,000 a year. ==History== The scholarship dates from 12 May 1830, and was funded in response to an application from subscribers. Although the scholarship is named for Lord Eldon LC, it is not, as is often supposed, funded from his will - Lord Eldon did not in fact die until eight years after the scholarship was founded. The first trustees included the Duke of Richmond, Earl of Mansfield, Earl of Romney and Lord Arden. Until 1963 it was a requirement that an applicant that was a member of the Church of England. In 1963 that was downgraded to a preference, and in 1983 the requirement was dropped entirely. ==Past winners== Past winners include: * Sir Robert Herbert, first Premier of Queensland, Australia * John Conington, classical scholar (who gave up the scholarship) * Ralph Lingen, 1st Baron Lingen, civil servant. * Alfred Hazel * Thomas Henry Haddan, founder of The Guardian * Alfred Barratt, philosopher * Murray Coutts-Trotter, Chief Justice of Madras High Court * Sir Frederick Lidell, civil servant."LIDDELL, Sir Frederick Francis", in *Lord Asquith of Bishopstone, Law Lord * Professor Sir Carleton Allen (1913) * Gordon Alchin (1920), poet. * Lord Denning (1921), Law Lord and Master of the Rolls * Lord Radcliffe (1923), Law Lord * Lord Wilberforce (1930), Law Lord. * John Morris (1933), academic * Sir James Fawcett (1935), President of the European Commission for Human Rights'FAWCETT, Sir James (Edmund Sandford)', Who Was Who, A. & C.
