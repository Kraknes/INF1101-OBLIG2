It was premiered by the Bavarian State Opera, conducted by Kent Nagano, on 27 October 2012. ==Background and performance history== The stage work Babylon was written by Jorg Widmann on a commission by the Bavarian State Opera. The opera was composed from 2011 to 2012. Librettist and composer were not held to any restrictions. The librettist Peter Sloterdijk describes life in a multi-religious and multi-cultural metropolis, the rise and fall of an empire. The Bavarian State Opera presented the world premiere of Widmann's Babylon, conducted by Kent Nagano on 27 October 2012 in National Theatre Munich. The production was directed by (La Fura dels Baus). A revised version of the opera was premiered on 9 March 2019 at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden Berlin. Conductor of the new production by was Christopher Ward, replacing Daniel Barenboim. In the revision Widmann used live electronics for the first time at the end. The first performance of Widmann's Babylon Suite, a commission of Grafenegg Festival and Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin, took place on 21 August 2014 in Grafenegg under the direction of Kent Nagano. The Babylon Suite is the concertante version of Widmann's opera. ==Reception== The premiere of Babylon was reviewed critically by several newspapers. The New York Times noted that Widmann's hard work received a major forum, that Sloterdijk's libretto is overstuffed and often inscrutable, and the production is extravagant. Die Zeit wrote about an indifferent libretto, a monstrous score and old men's lust (), Suddeutsche Zeitung about howling wind players, opulent pictures and strange music. Die Welt wrote: "alphabet soup of sound salad: orgiastic, bombastic" (""). The premiere of the revision of the opera in 2019 received positive and mostly negative "icely" reviews. ==Music== Babylon is a polystilistic opera. Example of a special musical style is Widmann's version of the Bayerischer Defiliermarsch and Tiroler Holzhackerbuab`n from his composition Dubairische Tanze in Scene III. Some other examples of self-quotation within the opera are Teufel Amor, Con brio, Antiphon and Messe. The work is characterized by cinematic editing techniques and various multimedia layers. ==Roles== {| class="wikitable plainrowheaders" ! scope="col" |Role ! scope="col" |Voice type ! scope="col" |Premiere cast, 27 October 2012 Conductor: Kent Nagano ! scope="col" |Premiere cast (revision), 9 March 2019 Conductor: Christopher Ward |- ! scope="row" | Inanna | high soprano | Anna Prohaska | Susanne Elmark |- ! scope="row" | Die Seele (The Soul) | high soprano | Claron McFadden | Mojca Erdmann |- ! scope="row" | Tammu | tenor | Jussi Myllys | |- ! scope="row" | Priesterkonig (Priest King) | bass-baritone | Willard White | John Tomlinson |- ! scope="row" | Der Tod (The Death) | bass-baritone | Willard White | Otto Katzameier |- ! scope="row" | Euphrat | dramatic mezzo soprano | Gabriele Schnaut | Marina Prudenskaya |- ! scope="row" | Skorpionmensch (Scorpion Man) | countertenor | Kai Wessel | Andrew Watts |- ! scope="row" | Priester (Priest) | tenor |Joshua Stewart |Florian Hoffmann |- ! scope="row" | Ezechiel | narrator | August Zirner | Felix von Manteuffel |} ==Instrumentation== Widmann scored Babylon for the following large orchester with 90 players: * Woodwinds: 4 flutes (all doubling piccolo, 3rd doubling alto flute, 4th doubling bass flute), 4 oboes (2nd doubling oboe d'amore, 3rd doubling cor anglais, 4th doubling heckelphone), 4 clarinets in B (2nd doubling clarinet in E, 3rd doubling bass clarinet, 4th doubling double bass clarinet), 4 bassoons (3rd and 4th double bassoon) * Brass: 4 horns (doubling 4 natural horns), 4 trumpets, 4 trombones (3rd and 4th doubling bass trombone or contrabass trombone), tuba * Strings: 14 violins I, 12 violins II, 10 violas, 8 cellos, 8 double basses (4 of them 5-stringed) * Percussion: 4 players, timpani * 2 harps, celesta, accordion, piano, organ ==Synopsis== The opera is about the conflicts that arise from the love of the exile and Jew Tammu to the Babylonian Inanna, priestess in the temple of free love.
