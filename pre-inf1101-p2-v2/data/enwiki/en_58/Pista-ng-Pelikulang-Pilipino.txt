Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino (), abbreviated as PPP, is a film festival held in the Philippines in celebration of the Buwan ng Wika. It is organized by the Film Development Council of the Philippines. Similar to the Metro Manila Film Festival, only shortlisted films will be shown in cinemas except in select 3D cinemas, VIP cinemas (in an opt-in/opt-out basis by developer) and IMAX theaters. The movies are classified into 3 categories. First are the Main Feature Films which are competing for the awards. Second are the "Sine Kabataan Shorts" which are 5-minute short films that are played before the feature film. Third are the Non-Competition entries which are movies that won in other film festivals and as such, are given special limited screening during the PPP festival. ==2017 edition== The first edition featuring 12 locally produced films selected by the Film Development Council of the Philippines was held from August 16 to 22, 2017. ===Entries=== Entry films had to be submitted in a finished state by June 15, 2017.
