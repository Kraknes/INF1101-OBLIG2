Salle Erard The salle Erard is a music venue located in Paris, 13 rue du Mail in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris. It is part of the hotel particulier which belonged, from the 18th century, to the family of piano, harp and harpsichord manufacturers. Small in size, but well isolated from the noises of the city, enjoying good acoustics, it is more particularly adapted to chamber music.gallica.bnf.fr (several pages) During the 19th and the beginning of the 20th, it was the place of premieres and debuts noted for both compositions and for interpreters, among which: Erik Satie (orchestrations of his Gymnopedies by Claude Debussy), Jacques Ibert, les histoires (ten pieces for piano) (1923), Nellie Melba, Ricardo Vines, Maurice Ravel, Miroirs (1906) , Menuet antique (1892), Histoires naturelles with Jane Bathori (1907), Sonate pour violon et piano (1927), Trois poemes de Mallarme (1914), Camille Saint-Saens (1860).,gallica.bnf.fr Ignacy Jan Paderewski (1888), Claude Debussy, Triptyque Estampes (1904), Le Promenoir des deux amants (1911), Alexander Scriabin (1896), Joseph Jongen, Andre Caplet , Conte fantastique with Micheline Kahn as the harpist, (1923) Vladimir de Pachmann (1882), Charles Valentin Alkan (1837) and (1880), Francis Poulenc, Reynaldo Hahn, pianist Edouard Risler (1908), Ernest Chausson, Viviane (1883), Cesar Franck, Le Chasseur maudit (1883), Arthur Honegger, Le Cahier romand (1924), Olivier Messiaen, Huit preludes (1930), Maurice Delage, Sept hai-kais (1925), Quatre poemes hindous (1914), Francis Plante,gallica.bnf.fr Stephan Elmas ou Youra Guller. Before the construction of the Maison de la Radio (1963), the hall served as a recording studio for the Radiodiffusion francaise. Nowadays, only the salon sees the organization of concerts, the volumes of the proper room having been reconverted (the volume of spaces is suggested by the organization of the roofs as well as the old entrance facade at No. 11 rue Paul Lelong - Paris 02). Nevertheless, it remains prized for its acoustics and its past charged with both musical and artistic history.vagnethierry.fr == See also == Societe Nationale de Musique == References == == External links == * Salle Erard on YouTube (promotion) * La Salle Erard a besoin de nous * La Salle Erard on France Musique * La Salle Erard, panorama on abcsalles.com Category:Buildings and structures in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris Category:Music venues in Paris
