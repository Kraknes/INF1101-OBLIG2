Lisa Hoke (born 1952 in Virginia) is an American installation artist and sculptor living and working in New York. ==Biography== Lisa Hoke received a BA from the University of North Carolina (1970-1974), a BFA from the Virginia Commonwealth University (1975-1978), and attended Florida State University for MFA studies (1979-1980). Hoke was awarded the Edwin Austin Abbey Fellowship from the National Academy Museum, New York in 2008, a Joan Mitchell Foundation Grant in 1996. Her work has been exhibited nationally, notably at the Sarasota Museum of Art, Oklahoma City Museum of Art, New Britain Museum of American Art, MASS MoCA, Aldrich Museum, the Hudson Valley Center for Contemporary Art, Cleveland Institute of Art, Serpentine Gallery, Corcoran Gallery of Art and the New Museum. Her work is in numerous public and private collations including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell University and New Orleans Museum of Art among others. In Italy she made the permanent installation in the new Lavazza HQ, in Turin. Jennifer Coates reviewed her most recent solo exhibition at Pavel Zoubok Gallery in Time Out (2015). The title for Hoke's latest show, Attention Shoppers (2015), is composed of works that are cobbled out of packaging and other consumer detritus including coffee cups, matchbooks, pasta boxes, candy wrappers and beer cans. These items have been flattened, folded, cut, and aggregated into objects that follow their own internal logic. Products have been combined according to color, transforming disposable objects into compositions with panache. In Aisle 3, freestanding and wall-mounted forms join together in an ensemble of greens and blues, the latter made from empty coffee sacks and rigatoni cartons. Swaths of red and yellow cardboard, covered in logos for Coke and Oh Henry! bars, swell and swirl in Coming Attractions. Hoke was elected a member of the National Academy of Design in 2018. == Exhibitions == 2017: Rotunda Projects: Lisa Hoke, Memphis Brooks Museum of Art, Memphis, TN 2016: Lisa Hoke: Common Side Effects, Esther Massry Gallery, The College of Saint Rose, Albany, NY 2015: Attention Shoppers, Pavel Zoubok Gallery, New York, NY 2014: ARTmuse Project, Sarasota Museum of Art, FL 2013: Come on Down, Oklahoma City Museum of Art, OK 2012: McNay Museum, San Antonio, TX 2012: Love, American Style, D'Amour Museum of Contemporary Art, Springfield, MA 2011: JJohnson Gallery, Jacksonville, FL 2011: Elizabeth Harris Gallery, New York, NY 2009: Brattleboro Museum of Contemporary Art, VT 2009: The Anthony Giordano Gallery, Dowling College, LI 2008: Elizabeth Harris Gallery, New York, NY 2008: New Britain Museum of American Art, New Britain, CT 2007: Elizabeth Harris Gallery, New York, NY 2007: Montclair Art Museum, Montclair, NJ 2006: Rice University Art Gallery, Summer Project, Houston, TX 2004: Elizabeth Harris Gallery, New York, NY 2002: Elizabeth Harris Gallery, New York, NY 1999: Ricochet, Holly Solomon Gallery, New York, NY 1998: Bucknell Art Gallery, Bucknell University, Lewisburg, PA 1998: Esso Gallery, Project Room, New York, NY 1995: A/D Gallery, New York, NYC 1994: Horodner Romley Gallery, New York, NY 1994: Galerie Christiane Chassey, Montreal, Quebec 1993: Horodner Romley Gallery, New York, NY 1993: Bernard Toale Gallery, Boston, MA 1989: Vaughan & Vaughan Gallery, Minneapolis, MN 1989: Rosa Esman Gallery, New York, NY ==References== Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American artists Category:American women installation artists Category:American installation artists Category:Artists from Virginia Category:Virginia Commonwealth University alumni Category:21st-century American women artists Category:20th-century American women artists Category:21st-century American artists Category:National Academy of Design members
