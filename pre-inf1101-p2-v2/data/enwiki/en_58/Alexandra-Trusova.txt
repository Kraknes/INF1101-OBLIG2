Alexandra "Sasha" Vyacheslavovna Trusova (; ; born 23 June 2004) is a Russian figure skater, who currently holds the world record for the free skate (166.62 points). She is the 2020 European Bronze Medalist, the 2019 Grand Prix Final bronze medalist, the 2019 Skate Canada champion, the 2019 Rostelecom Cup champion, the 2019 CS Ondrej Nepela champion, the 2019 Russian national silver medalist, and the 2020 Russian national bronze medalist. On the junior level, she is a two-time Junior World champion (2018, 2019), the 2017 Junior Grand Prix Final champion, the 2018 Junior Grand Prix Final silver medalist, and a two-time Russian junior national champion (2018, 2019). Trusova is the first female skater to land the quad Lutz, flip, and toe loop jumps, the second to land the quad Salchow after Miki Ando, and the first to land two and three ratified quads in a free skate, achieved at the 2018 Junior World Championships and the 2019 Nepela Trophy, respectively. She currently holds four Guinness World Records; the fourth being in recognition of the quadruple flip she landed in the 2019 ISU Grand Prix Final.https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/stories/news/detail/alexandra-trusova- guinness-world-records/ Her technical score of 92.35 points in the free skate at the 2018 Junior Worlds was the highest ever recorded in women's figure skating on both the junior and senior level until the GOE (Grade of Execution) system was changed at the end of 2017-18 season. At 13 years old, Trusova was the youngest female to win the Junior World Championships and Junior Grand Prix Final. At the 2018 JGP Lithuania, Trusova set another milestone by becoming the first female skater to land a quad in combination (quad toe loop + triple toe loop). A few weeks later, at the 2018 JGP Armenia, her quad Lutz jump was deemed fully rotated, making her the first female skater to land the jump in international competition. Trusova is the first and currently only female skater competing with four different types of quadruple jumps--toe loop, Salchow, flip, and Lutz. She is the also first female skater in history to score above 100 in technical elements when she recorded 100.20 technical points in the free skate at the 2019 Skate Canada. She is currently the fourth highest ranked ladies' singles skater in world by the International Skating Union following the 2019-20 figure skating season. == Personal life == Trusova was born on 23 June 2004 in Ryazan. The eldest of three children, she has two younger brothers named Egor and Ivan. As an avid dog lover, Trusova has a pet chihuahua named Tina, who often accompanies her to competitions,https://sport24.ru/news/other/2019-09-08-figurnoye-kataniye- zagitova-prezentovala-proizvolnuyu-programmu-v-roli-kleopatry-foto-video- instagram a pet husky, Jack, and a miniature royal poodle, Lana, which she received at Rostelecom Cup for winning the 2019 World Junior Figure Skating Championships and for landing her first triple Axel in practice. == Career == === Early career === Trusova began learning to skate in 2008. She trained in Ryazan under Olga Shevtsova until 2015; she then moved to Moscow where she was coached by Alexander Volkov. Eteri Tutberidze and Sergei Dudakov became her coaches in 2016. Trusova finished 4th at the 2017 Russian Junior Championships after placing 6th in the short program and 4th in the free skate. === 2017-2018 season: Junior international debut and achievement of quad in competition === Trusova's international debut came in late August 2017 at a 2017-18 ISU Junior Grand Prix (JGP) competition in Brisbane, Australia. Ranked first in both segments, she won the gold medal ahead of teammate Anastasia Gulyakova. She landed an underrotated quad Salchow in her free program. Her total score at the event, 197.69 points, is the third highest ever achieved by a ladies' single skater on the junior level at the time, behind only Alina Zagitova and Marin Honda. She then finished first at JGP Belarus, thus qualifying for the Junior Grand Prix Final. At the 2017-18 Junior Grand Prix Final, Trusova scored 73.25 points, breaking the Junior Ladies World record for the short program. In the free skate, she scored 132.36 points, which was about 0.5 points less than what her teammate and training partner, Alena Kostornaia, scored. However, because of Trusova's 1.5 point lead after the short program, she won the competition by about 1 point. In January 2018, Trusova won the gold medal at the 2018 Russian Junior Championships after placing first in the short program and third in the free skate. Again, she narrowly beat her training partner Alena Kostornaia, winner of the silver medal, by only about 0.6 points. Kostornaia (left) at the 2018 World Junior Championships podium In March 2018, Trusova competed at the 2018 Junior Worlds where she won the gold medal after placing first in both the short program and the free skate. Her free skating score of 153.49 points was the new World record for the junior free program. Her total score of 225.52 points was the new World record for the junior combined total score. At this competition, Trusova became the first female skater to land the quad toe loop, the second to land the quad Salchow behind Miki Ando, and the first to land two ratified quads in a free skate. She landed the quadruple jump for the first time in 16 years since Miki Ando in 2002. Her technical score of 92.35 points in the free skate at the 2018 Junior World was the highest ever recorded in women's figure skating on both the junior and senior level. Interestingly, her total score of 225.52 would have placed her first in the senior women's World Championships that year as well, despite significantly lower program component scores and the absence of a choreographic sequence. === 2018-2019 season: Second Junior World title === Trusova started her season by competing in the 2018 Junior Grand Prix (JGP) series. At her first JGP event of the season she won the gold medal in Kaunas, Lithuania. She was ranked first in both the short program and the free skate and won the gold medal by a margin of about 30 points over the silver medalist, Kim Ye-lim. As of September 2018, her scores at this competition are the highest scores achieved in an international junior ladies competition. At this competition Trusova became the first female skater to land a quad in combination - a quad toe loop + triple toe loop; she received 16.14 points for this combination. She also became the first female skater to attempt a quad Lutz in a competition. She landed the jump, but it was credited as under rotated. At her second JGP event of the season she won another gold medal in Yerevan, Armenia. Again she was ranked first in both the short program and the free skate and won the gold medal by a margin of about 33 points over the silver medalist, her teammate Alena Kanysheva. Trusova also upgraded her earlier free skate world record score. At this competition Trusova became the first female skater to land a quadruple Lutz in international competition. A few days earlier Anna Shcherbakova had landed two quadruple Lutz jumps in a domestic competition. With two Junior Grand Prix gold medals Trusova qualified for the 2018-19 Junior Grand Prix Final. At the JGP Final she won the silver medal after placing second in both the short program and the free skate. She was outscored by the gold medalist, her teammate and training partner Alena Kostornaia, by about 2.5 points. In the free skate, Trusova landed a clean quad toe loop but she had a step-out on her first quad Lutz and fell on her second quad Lutz which was deemed under-rotated. Competing next at the 2019 Russian Championships, Trusova placed second in the short program and second in the free skate to win the silver medal overall. In the free skate, she landed a quad Lutz but fell on an under-rotated quad toe loop, finishing behind teammate Anna Shcherbakova by 0.07 points. Speaking afterward, Trusova said she planned to work more on her quad jumps prior to the 2019 Junior World Championships. Trusova successfully defended her Junior World title at the 2019 World Junior Championships after placing second in the short program to teammate Anna Shcherbakova and winning the free program. === 2019-2020 season: Senior international debut === Trusova made her international senior debut at the 2019 CS Ondrej Nepela Memorial where she won the gold medal and set several new world records. In free skating she became the first lady ever to land three quadruples when she landed a quad Lutz and two quad toe loops, the second in combination. She set the new free skating record of 163.78 points and also the new combined total record of 238.69 points. Her technical element score (TES) of 98.34 points in free skating was also the new world record. She earned 14.72 points for her quadruple Lutz which was the new record for the highest valued single jump. On October 5, Trusova skated in the team competition at the Japan Open, where she won the event with fours quads; quad Salchow, quad Lutz, quad toe-triple toe, and a quad toe-Euler-triple Salchow combination, scoring over 160 points. Since it was not an official ISU competition, her historic number of quads were not officially recognized as the first in international competition. Trusova made her ISU Grand Prix debut at the 2019 Skate Canada International, where she won the gold medal after placing third in the short program and first in the free skate. At this competition she became the first lady ever to land two quad-triple jump combinations in one program in ISU sanctioned international competition with a quad toe loop-triple toe loop and quad toe loop-Euler-triple Salchow. She also became the first lady to land a quad-triple jump combination in the second half of the free skate. At the same competition she set the new free skating record of 166.62 points and also the new combined total record of 241.02 points. Her technical element score (TES) of 100.20 points in free skating was also the new world record. At her second Grand Prix, the 2019 Rostelecom Cup, Trusova placed second in the short program behind Evgenia Medvedeva. She was first in the free skate, despite again falling on her opening quad Salchow attempt and another fall on a triple combination later, winning her second Grand Prix gold medal. Trusova's results qualified her for the Grand Prix Final in Torino. Skating in the short program, Trusova opted to attempt the triple Axel in competition for the first time, but underrotated and fell on it. Consequently, she placed fifth in that segment, fourteen points behind first-place Alena Kostornaia. Trusova said that the decision to introduce the triple Axel had been taken in light of its being landed "more or less consistently" in practices in the preceding week, and remarked "I like to risk, and without risking, I wouldn't achieve what I have by this moment." In the free skate, Trusova attempted the quad flip in competition for the first time, landing it cleanly, alongside a quad Lutz and a quad toe loop, but doubled an intended quad Salchow and fell on a second quad toe attempt. She became the first female skater to attempt five quads in a free skate, as well as the first to attempt four different types of quads. Third in the free, she rose to the bronze medal position behind Kostornaia and Anna Shcherbakova. At the 2020 Russian Championships, Trusova placed third in the short program, opting not to attempt the triple Axel. The free skate proved a struggle, with two falls on her quad Lutz and quad flip attempts, and doubling out on her first attempted quad toe loop. She went on to land her second quad toe attempt, as well as her remaining triple jumps, and remained in third place. She described herself as "not pleased" with the performance, but said she hoped to master the quad loop by the end of the season. Competing at the 2020 European Championships, Trusova doubled a planned triple Axel and turned out of it. She scored 74.95 points and placed 3rd in that segment behind Alena Kostornaia and Anna Shcherbakova. In the free skate, she fell on two planned quads, but landed her quad toe-triple toe combination successfully. She placed third overall behind her two teammates, winning the bronze medal. Trusova was also assigned to compete at the 2020 World Championships in Montreal, but these were cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. On May 6, 2020, it was announced by Russian media outlets Nevasport and Sport24 that Trusova had decided to part ways with coach Eteri Tutberidze in favor of joining Evgeni Plushenko's academy. Trusova was joined in the departure by coach Sergei Rozanov, as well as novice training-mates Veronika and Alyona Zhilina. According to Sport24, Trusova chose to leave the Tutberidze group due to lack of attention from Tutberidze herself during the months following the cancellation of the World Championships, as well as dissatisfaction with her position in the training group overall. === 2020-2021 season === In August it was announced that Trusova was assigned to the second and fourth events of the 2020 Russian Cup Series. Trusova performed at the 2020 Russian Test Skates where she successfully executed a quad toe in combination. https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/stories/news/detail/kolyada-comeback- medvedeva-new-choreo-5-things-from-russian-test-skate/ == Programs == {|class=wikitable style=text-align:center !
