Jordan Lee Williams (born 22 October 1999) is an English professional footballer who plays as a right back for Championship club Barnsley. A product of the Huddersfield Town Academy, he was loaned out to Bury in August 2017, just 2 days after making his debut in the League Cup against Rotherham United. ==Career== Brought up in Huddersfield, Williams joined Huddersfield Town aged 9, and gradually went up the ranks, including winning two England under-18 caps. He made his competitive first team debut for the Terriers in their EFL Cup second round match against Rotherham United at the John Smith's Stadium on 23 August 2017.
