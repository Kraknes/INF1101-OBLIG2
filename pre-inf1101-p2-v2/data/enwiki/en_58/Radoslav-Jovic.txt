Radoslav Jovic () is a politician and medical doctor in Serbia. He served three terms in the National Assembly of Serbia between 1997 and 2008, originally with the Serbian Renewal Movement (Srpski pokret obnove, SPO) and later with the breakaway Serbian Democratic Renewal Movement (Srpski Demokratski Pokret Obnove, SDPO). He was also the mayor of Kraljevo from 2003 to 2005. In 2014, Jovic returned to the assembly as a member of the Serbian Progressive Party (Srpska napredna stranka, SNS). ==Early life and career== Jovic was born in Kraljevo, then part of the People's Republic of Serbia in the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia.RADOSLAV JOVIC, Otvoreni Parlament, accessed 21 August 2017. He trained as a doctor and conducted research on malignant tumours. In his fourth year of medical school, he promoted the notion of cancer as a form of evolutionary regression on the cellular level and suggested that it could be countered through the selective use of viruses. His research was covered in the Serbian media and published in book form in 1997. When American researchers published similar findings in 2005, some suggested the possibility of a direct influence.D. STOJIC, "Ubica kancera krenuo iz Kraljeva", Novosti, 6 March 2005, accessed 21 August 2017. ==Political career== ===SPO representative, mayor, and SDPO representative=== Jovic first entered the National Assembly of Serbia after the 1997 Serbian parliamentary election, in which he received the lead position on the SPO's electoral list for the Kraljevo division. The party won two mandates in the division, and he was declared elected.ZBIRNE IZBORNE LISTE (21 Kraljevo) and Izveshtaj o ukupnim rezultatima izbora za narodne poslanike u Narodnu skupshtinu Republike Srbije, odrzhanikh 21. i 28. septembra i 5. oktobra 1997. godine, Izbori za narodne poslanike Narodne skupshtine odrzhani 21. i 28. septembra i 5. oktobra 1997. godine, Republika Srbija - Republicka izborna komisija, accessed 1 March 2017. From 1992 to 2000, Serbia's electoral law stipulated that one- third of parliamentary mandates would be assigned to candidates from successful lists in numerical order, while the remaining two-thirds would be distributed amongst other candidates on the lists by the sponsoring parties. Jovic automatically received a mandate by virtue of his position on the list. See Guide to the Early Election, Ministry of Information of the Republic of Serbia, December 1992, made available by the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, accessed 14 July 2017. The Socialist Party of Serbia and its allies won the election, the SPO served in opposition. Jovic served as president of the Kraljevo municipal assembly in this period. In 1998, he helped establish the annual Kraljevdan event as a celebration of the city's royalist history.Z. Nikolic, "Kraljevo danas slavi svoj Kraljevdan", Danas, 7 October 2016, accessed 21 August 2017. He called on other Serbian towns to take in more Kosovo Serb refugees the following year, after Kraljevo's resources were challenged by a large number of refugees converging on the city."Kraljevo mayor wants Kosovo Serbs accommodated in other Serbian towns," British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European - Political, 1 September 1999 (Source: Beta news agency, Belgrade, in Serbo-Croat 1617 gmt 1 Sep 99). This article's description of Jovic as having been the city's mayor in 1998 appears to be inaccurate. Serbia's political system was reformed for the 2000 parliamentary election, the first to be held after the downfall of Slobodan Milosevic's administration. The entire country became a single electoral district, and mandates were awarded to parties instead of individual candidates, with the result that successful parties often distributed their mandates out of numerical order to candidates on their electoral lists.Serbia's Law on the Election of Representatives (2000) stipulated that parliamentary mandates would be awarded to electoral lists (Article 80) that crossed the electoral threshold (Article 81), that mandates would be given to candidates appearing on the relevant lists (Article 83), and that the submitters of the lists were responsible for selecting their parliamentary delegations within ten days of the final results being published (Article 84). See Law on the Election of Representatives, Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 35/2000, made available via LegislationOnline, accessed 28 February 2017. The SPO ran its own slate rather than joining a broad coalition called the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), which consisted of several parties that had opposed Milosevic's rule. This proved to be a strategic error; the DOS won a landslide victory while the SPO did not receive a sufficient number of votes to cross the electoral threshold to win representation in the assembly. Jovic, who was included in the SPO list, saw his parliamentary career come to a temporary end.Jovic received the seventy- seventh position on the party's list, which was mostly arranged in alphabetical order. See Izbori za narodne poslanike Narodne skupshtine odrzhani 23. detsembra 2000. godine i 10. januara 2001. godine, IZBORNE LISTE (,,Srpski pokret obnove - Vuk Drashkovitsh" - Vuk Drashkovitsh), Republika Srbija - Republicka izborna komisija, accessed 7 April 2017. Jovic became the mayor of Kraljevo via direct elections in 2003, defeating a candidate of the Democratic Party of Serbia in a run-off.The party identification of Jovic's opponent can be confirmed via "Ruling coalition suffers local election defeat in two Serbian towns," British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 17 November 2003 (Source: Radio B92 text web site, Belgrade, in English 1702 gmt 17 Nov 03). As mayor, he oversaw privatization proceedings for Magnohrom, a lead industrial firm in the city."Serbia To Sell Magnohrom in June 2005," Serbia and Montenegro News Digest, 2 March 2005. He resigned in 2005 rather than defending his position in a recall referendum that had been initiated by the Serbian Radical Party; Jovic argued that he did not want to defend his position at taxpayers' expense. He later challenged the legality of the recall proceedings.M. Dugalitsh, ",,Fotelja" pred sudom u Strazburu", Politika, 9 May 2011, accessed 21 August 2017. The SPO contested the 2003 parliamentary election in an alliance with New Serbia. Jovic received the tenth position on the combined list and was selected as an SPO delegate after the list won twenty-two mandates.Izbori za narodne poslanike Narodne skupshtine odrzhani 28. detsembra 2003. godine, IZBORNE LISTE (SRPSKI POKRET OBNOVE - NOVA SRBIJA - VUK DRAShKOVITsh - VELIMIR ILITsh), Republika Srbija - Republicka izborna komisija, accessed 7 April 2017. He took his seat when the assembly met in 2004.27 January 2004 legislature, National Assembly of Serbia, accessed 21 August 2017. The SPO was part of Vojislav Kostunica's coalition government in this period, and Jovic served as part of the government's parliamentary majority. The SPO experienced a serious split in 2005, and several of its members, including Jovic, joined the breakaway Serbian Democratic Renewal Movement. The party contested the 2007 parliamentary election as a junior partner on a coalition list led by the Democratic Party of Serbia and New Serbia; Jovic received the ninety-seventh list position.Izbori za narodne poslanike Narodne skupshtine odrzhani 21. januara i 8. febrauara 2007. godine, IZBORNE LISTE (Demokratska stranka Srbije - Nova Srbija - dr Vojislav Koshtunitsa), Republika Srbija - Republicka izborna komisija, accessed 26 April 2017. The coalition won forty-seven seats, and Jovic was one of two SDPO candidates to be awarded a new mandate."Spisak poslanika za Skupshtinu Srbije", Politika, 13 February 2007, accessed 31 May 2008. The party provided support to Vojislav Kostunica's government, and Jovic again served with the government's parliamentary majority.M. Chekerevats, "Retka zakonodavna initsijativa poslanika", Politika, 30 July 2007, accessed 31 May 2018. The SDPO did not contest the 2008 election. ===SNS representative=== The SDPO ceased to exist in 2010. Jovic later joined the Serbian Progressive Party. Serbia's electoral system was reformed in 2011, such that parliamentary mandates were awarded in numerical order to candidates on successful lists. Jovic received the eighty-second position on the Progressive Party's Aleksandar Vucic -- Future We Believe In list in the 2014 parliamentary election and returned to the assembly when the list won a majority with 158 out of 250 mandates.Izbori za narodne poslanike Narodne skupshtine odrzhani 16. i 23. marta 2014. godine, IZBORNE LISTE (ALEKSANDAR VUCIC - BUDUCNOST U KOJU VERUJEMO), Republika Srbija - Republicka izborna komisija, accessed 26 January 2017.

The Progressive-led alliance won a second consecutive majority with 131 mandates; Jovic was not immediately re-elected but was able to take his seat once again on October 6, 2016, following the resignation of other Progressive Party members further up the list.Izbori za narodne poslanike 2016. godine >> Dodela mandata, Odluka o dodeli mandata narodnikh poslanika radi popune uprazhnjenikh poslanichkikh mesta u Narodnoj skupshtini od 5. oktobra 2016. godine. godine], Republika Srbija - Republicka izborna komisija, accessed 17 August 2017. ==References== Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the National Assembly of Serbia Category:Mayors of places in Serbia Category:People from Kraljevo Category:Serbian Renewal Movement politicians Category:Serbian Democratic Renewal Movement politicians Category:Serbian Progressive Party politicians
