Coproduction Office is a film production and international sales company specialised in art-house films. Founded in 1987 by Philippe Bober, it includes a sales agency and three production divisions based in Berlin, Paris and Copenhagen. Over the last two decades, it has mainly produced and handled films by Ulrich Seidl, Jessica Hausner, Roy Andersson, Michelangelo Frammartino, Thomas Clay, Kornel Mundruczo, Ilya Khrzhanovsky, Carlos Reygadas, and Ruben Ostlund, and has also sold single films by, among others, Takashi Miike, Antonio Campos, Cristi Puiu, Corneliu Porumboiu, Gust Van den Berghe. == History == Founded in 1987 by Philippe Bober, the company was named after its efforts to raise funds for Europa by Lars von Trier (Jury Prize at Cannes in 1991). Europa was a four-country coproduction and was supported by Eurimages during its very first session in 1989 and Bober acted as associate producer for Germany and France. For von Trier's following project, The Kingdom, Coproduction Office was involved both as German co-producer and international seller, closing deals in territories where the 4 hours television series was distributed theatrically (by USA Films, formerly October Films in the U.S.; ICA Projects in the United Kingdom; Haut et Cour in France; Shochiku in Japan, Key Films in Italy or Essential Films in Germany, the then newly created, Berlin-based production arm of Coproduction Office). In 1996, after producing Breaking The Waves for the joint production venture Liberator Productions with Zentropa, according to Variety Bober was one of the first professionals to handle Scandinavian films: the company established ongoing relationships with Swedish directors Roy Andersson and Ruben Ostlund and produced the film Noi Albinoi by Dagur Kari together with Iceland's Zik Zak Filmworks. In 2000 Coproduction Office expanded its production activities adding production divisions in Paris and later, in 2007, in Copenhagen. According to an interview for Cineuropa, the combination of production and sales enables the company to be selective in the process of choosing which projects to develop. "Having freedom of choice has always been an obsession of mine," added Bober, highlighting that he "also spent three months per year for over 15 years viewing films, going to festivals, looking for information about directors: focusing on a few films is a deliberate choice and the result of this work." Philippe Bober has been working with filmmakers since the beginning of their career. He started working with Ruben Ostlund, Jessica Hausner, Dagur Kari, Kornel Mundruczo through their short films and went on producing and/or selling their work starting from their debut films, including the first features of Michelangelo Frammartino, Gust Van den Berghe, Ulrich Seidl, Carlos Reygadas, Ilya Khrzhanovsky > "The first thing people notice in our catalogue is the fact that our films > are very visual. When I choose to commit to a project, it is true that I am > less interested in the story than the way it is told, the way it is staged. > Nevertheless, it doesn't exclude a certain coherence between the style and > content. Besides, I think that auteurs that push the style the furthest are > the ones with the most personal things to tell," said Philippe Bober about > the company's line-up. Coproduction Office is currently involved in the making of several projects at various stages of development: the untitled new films by Michelangelo Frammartino, Thomas Clay, Ulrich Seidl, Roy Andersson, Heinrich Sabl, Gust van den Berghe and Ilya Khrzhanovsky. == Film Library == The films produced or sold by Coproduction Office participated to a number of international festivals, including Cannes (with 11 nominations in the official Competition, 8 first features and 13 awards across sections), Venice (with 8 nominations in the official Competition, 5 first features and 8 awards across sections) and Berlin (3 nominations in Competition). 19 of these Competition titles were produced or co-produced by Philippe Bober. == Awards == *Cannes Film Festival **2019: Prix d'interpretation feminine -
