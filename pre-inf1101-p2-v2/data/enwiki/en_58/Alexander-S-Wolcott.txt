Alexander Simon Wolcott (also Alexander S. Wolcott and A. S. Wolcott; June 14, 1804 - March 26, 1844) was an experimental photographer, inventor, maker of medical supplies. With John Johnson, he created the world's first commercial photography portrait studio and patented the first US camera that made photographs. == Early life == Wolcott was born on June 14, 1804, in New London, Connecticut. He was the son of Alexander Wolcott, Sr. and Joanne (Paull) Wolcott. == Photography == Wolcott reflector mirror camera diagram of patent No. 1,582 Wolcott's box camera invention patented May 8, 1840 Wolcott lived in New York City in the 1830s and made dental supplies for a living. He worked in the mechanics of designing instruments that used optics. In 1839 he became an associated with John Johnson, a jeweler and watchmaker's assistant. Together they established the firm 'Wolcott and Johnson' at 52 First Street in New York City. The small business manufactured dental equipment and related supplies. Johnson learned about Daguerre's photographic mechanics on how to make a camera soon after the details had arrived in America on September 20, 1839. On October 6, 1839, he took to Wolcott a copy of the specifications on Daguerre's method of capturing a likeness of a person and storing on a permanent plate that would hold the picture indefinitely. They made a camera that day based on Daguerre's method and started experimenting with it. Wolcott improved on Daguerre's lens camera by making a camera that used a concave mirror to gather more light instead of a simple refractive lens that gathered little light. On October 7, 1839, Wolcott took a photo of Johnson with his daguerreotype reflector camera, creating the first photograph portrait in the world. Wolcott patented the camera on May 8, 1840 (US #1,582). It became known as "Wolcott's camera" and the "mirror camera". It was the first US patent in photography. Wolcott and Johnson started using their camera on March 4, 1840, in a business in the Granite Building on Broadway, the Daguerreian Parlor, that made commercial portraits in a studio. It was the world's first commercial daguerreotype gallery, a portrait photography studio. By June, they had opened a branch in Washington D.C., operated by John G. Stevenson. Wolcott's camera used a polished concave mirror to reflect the focused light onto a photosensitive plate less than a half inch square. The pictures were not a negative image of reverse colors, but a correct positive image that did not require reversion of the image. The size of the photo-sensitive plate was eventually increased to just over two square inches that they could make a likeness image, because of their refined mechanical lighting techniques. Wolcott and Johnson continued to improve their photography techniques. Wolcott improved his photosensitive plate and created a chemical "accelerator", a mix of bromide and chloride. This, along with improved polished silver plates, earned them a second U.S. patent in photography in December 1841, designated #2,391. They also designed outdoor mirrors that provided more light inside the studio for faster higher quality portrait pictures. == Death == Wolcott died on November 10, 1844, at age 39 in Stamford, Connecticut. == References == == Sources == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:1804 births Category:1844 deaths Category:People from New London, Connecticut Category:19th-century American inventors Category:American photographers
