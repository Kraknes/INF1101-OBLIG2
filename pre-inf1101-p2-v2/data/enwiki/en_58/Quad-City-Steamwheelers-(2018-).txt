The Quad City Steamwheelers are an indoor American football team that began play in 2018. They played their first season as part of the Champions Indoor Football, but have joined the Indoor Football League in advance of their second season. Based in Moline, Illinois, the Steamwheelers play their home games at the TaxSlayer Center. The Steamwheelers are named after the Quad Cities' previous team of the same name, which played in all ten of the AF2's seasons (2000-2009) and won the first two ArenaCups. ==History== After the original Quad City Steamwheelers folded along with the AF2, TaxSlayer Center director Scott Mullen had been in talks with various investors seeking to bring back the Steamwheelers, but none were financially secure enough to meet his standards. During 2017, a splash page emerged allegedly belonging to a revived Steamwheelers team in the CIF, however, neither Mullen nor the CIF would comment on the page. On August 15, 2017, the Center confirmed that a deal had been reached which would see the Wheelers return as members of the CIF for 2018, with a press conference taking place the following day. At the press conference, the Wheelers introduced their owner/general manager Doug Bland (previously part-owner of fellow CIF team the Dallas Marshals) and head coach Cory Ross (most recently head coach for the Omaha Beef). After one season in the CIF, the Steamwheelers announced they were joining the Indoor Football League for the 2019 season. ==Roster== {| class="toccolours" style="text-align: left;" |+ colspan="7" style="; text-align:center;" | Quad City Steamwheelers roster |- | style="font-size: 95%;vertical-align:top;" | Quarterbacks Running backs Wide receivers | style="width: 25px;" | | style="font-size: 95%;vertical-align:top;" | Offensive linemen Defensive linemen | style="width: 25px;" | | style="font-size: 95%;vertical-align:top;" | Linebackers Defensive backs Special teams | style="width: 25px;" | | style="font-size: 95%;vertical-align:top;" | Reserve lists Rookies in italics Roster updated May 3, 2018 25 Active, 5 Inactive - More rosters |- |} ==Statistics and records== ===Season-by-season results=== {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; font-size:75%;" |- | style="background:#fcc;"|League Champions | style="background:#dfd;"|Conference Champions | style="background:#d0e7ff;"|Division Champions | style="background:#96cdcd;"|Playoff berth | style="background:#c8a2c8;"|League leader |} {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; font-size: 95%;" |- !rowspan="2" | Season !rowspan="2" | League !rowspan="2" | Conference !rowspan="2" | Division !colspan="4" | Regular season !rowspan="2" | Postseason results |- !
