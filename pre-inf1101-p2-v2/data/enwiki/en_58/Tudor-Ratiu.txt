Oberwolfach in 2013 Tudor Stefan Ratiu (born March 18, 1950 in Timisoara) is a Romanian-American mathematician who has made contributions to geometric mechanics and dynamical systems theory. ==Education== His father, Mircea Ratiu, an engineer, was the younger brother on Ion Ratiu, a well-known Romanian politician, while his mother, Rodica Bucur, was a piano professor at the Conservatory of Music in Timisoara. Ratiu did his undergraduate studies at the University of Timisoara, completing his B.Sc. in 1973 and his M.S. in 1974. After moving to the United States, he completed his Ph.D. degree at the University of California, Berkeley in 1980; his dissertation, written under the supervision of Jerrold E. Marsden, was titled Euler-Poisson Equations on Lie Algebras. ==Career== From 1980 to 1983 he was a T. H. Hildebrandt Research Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan, after which he became an Associate Professor of Mathematics at the University of Arizona. In 1987 he moved to the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he became a Professor of Mathematics in 1988.. In 1998 Ratiu moved to the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, where he was a professor until 2015. In 2014-15, he was a Professor of Mathematics at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology in Russia. Since 2016 he is a professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China. Ratiu received a Sloan Research Fellowship in 1980, and he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2012. ==Publications== * * * * * == References == ==External links== * Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:People from Timisoara Category:20th-century Romanian mathematicians Category:21st-century Romanian mathematicians Category:Politehnica University of Timisoara alumni Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:University of Michigan faculty Category:University of Arizona faculty Category:University of California, Santa Cruz faculty Category:Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne faculty Category:Shanghai Jiao Tong University faculty Category:Dynamical systems theorists Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society Category:Sloan Research Fellows
