Glowe commented that "about one of every six monsters is, or should be classified as dumb" but that "I still recommend this book. It will be a valuable aid to novice and expert alike." Don Turnbull reviewed All the Worlds' Monsters for White Dwarf #5, and stated that "I would prefer the editors to have been a lot more discriminating - either they could have included fewer monsters [...] or filled the gaps with more worthwhile beasts from whatever source. In aiming for quantity I think they have sacrificed a degree of quality." Don Turnbull reviewed All the Worlds' Monsters Volume II for White Dwarf #12, giving it an overall rating of 5 out of 10, and stated that "my conclusion is very much the same as for volume I. I with the editors had been a little more discriminating, ruthlessly chopping out the uninteresting and the 'randomly-generated' monster and perhaps lowering the price of the final version. But they have included more interesting monsters than did volume I and on the whole I can give this collection a marginally better recommendation." Steve Jackson reviewed All the Worlds' Monsters, Volume III in The Space Gamer No. 29. Jackson commented that "Not the best-done monster book in the world [...] and a bit high-priced. If you liked previous volumes of All the Worlds' Monsters, you'll love this; it's more of the same. Otherwise, recommended mainly for diehard D&D; people, or Runequest fans who want to populate their world with some rather silly creatures." ==References== ==External links== * Category:Chaosium games Category:Fantasy role-playing game supplements
