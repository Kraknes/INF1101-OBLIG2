Monastery of Banja, site of the Patriarchal Synod of 1571 Antonije I Sokolovic () was the Archbishop of Pec and Serbian Patriarch from 1571 to 1574. He was the second primate of the restored Serbian Patriarchate of Pec, and nephew of previous Serbian Patriarch Makarije I. Antonije was born into the Serbian Sokolovic family that gained prominence during the course of the 16th century. Its Christian branch gave several Serbian Patriarchs and Metropolitans, while a second branch (which converted to Islam) gave several viziers of the Ottoman Empire, including the Grand Vizier Mehmed Sokolovic (1565-1579). During the patriarchal tenure of his uncle Makarije I (1557-1571), Antonije became Metropolitan of Herzegovina. In 1571, the old patriarch fell ill and convoked a church synod in the Banja Monastery near the city of Priboj. There he relinquished his throne, and Metropolitan Antonije was elected his successor and new Serbian Patriarch. He lived in the Patriarchal Monastery of Pec. In that time, western eparchies of the Serbian Patriarchate were affected by the Ottoman-Venetian War (1570-1573) and massive demographic migrations. Patriarch Antonije stayed at his throne until death in 1574. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * ==External links== * Official site of the Serbian Orthodox Church: Serbian Archbishops and Patriarchs Antonije I Category:16th-century Eastern Orthodox bishops Category:16th- century Serbian people Category:16th century in Serbia Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1574 deaths Category:Ottoman Serbia Category:16th-century people of the Ottoman Empire
