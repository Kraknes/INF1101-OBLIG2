A dry white Bordeaux. In the Bordeaux wine region there are seven regional Appellations d'origine controlee (AOCs) that may be used throughout the Gironde department. These are Bordeaux Rouge AOC, Bordeaux Superieur Rouge, Bordeaux Clairet, Bordeaux Rose, Bordeaux Blanc, a dry white, Bordeaux Superieur Blanc, a sweet white, and Cremant de Bordeaux, a sparkling methode traditionnelle wine. The regional appellations together form the largest world-class wine vineyard, making up more than half of the production of the prestigious Bordeaux wine region, and representing more than 55% of all Bordeaux wines consumed in the world.CIVB Economie et Etudes 16/11/2010 == Bordeaux AOC == === Wine style === The entry-level Bordeaux AOC reds are fruity and easy-to-drink, and meant for early consumption rather than cellaring. More ambitious reds are usually sold as Bordeaux Superieur AOC. Notable exceptions to the general rule of Bordeaux AOC as simpler wines are some dry white wines produced in Medoc and Sauternes, where the production of red and sweet wines dominate. In difference from most of Graves, these areas are not allowed to use any other designation than Bordeaux Blanc AOC for dry white wines. Thus, some very ambitious and expensive dry white wines, such as Chateau Margaux's Pavillon Blanc and Chateau d'Yquem's "Y" have to be classified as "simple" Bordeaux Blancs. All rose and clairet wines are produced under regional appellations. === Production and Area === The vineyard area devoted to the production of Bordeaux AOC wines is approximately , of which are used for red wineBordeaux.com: Bordeaux and Bordeaux Superieur: Appellations: Bordeaux, accessed on 1 October 2008 and for white wine.Bordeaux.com: Dry white wine: Appellations: Bordeaux, accessed on 1 October 2008 Average yearly production is 3,300,000 hectolitres, corresponding to approximately 431 million 75 cl bottles, with 2,300,100 hectolitres of red wine and 304,000 hectolitres of white wine. The maximal authorized yield for Bordeaux AOC is 55 hectoliter per hectare, and the alcohol level of the wine must be between 10 and 13 volume percent. Dry white Bordeaux may not have more than 4 grams per litre of residual sugar. === Grape Varieties === For red wines, the most planted grape varietals are Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. As most regional Bordeaux AOC wines are produced on the Right Bank, Cabernet Franc is often found in the blend. Winemakers are using more and more Malbec,http://biggerthanyourhead.net/2011/10/07/glamorous-malbec-from-chateau- tire-pe/ Glamorous Malbec From Chateau Tire Pe, article by Fredric Koeppel but Petit Verdot is not often seen. For white wines, Sauvignon blanc and Semillon each represent 42% of the vineyard surface and Muscadelle 9%. == Bordeaux Superieur Rouge AOC == A bottle of Bordeaux Superieur red wine The Bordeaux Superieur appellation covers the same geographic area as Bordeaux AOC. However, the wine in this appellation is often produced by single parcels of older vines. Moreover, Bordeaux Superieur wines must be aged for at least nine months before they can be sold. Just like regular Bordeaux these are blends, with the reds being predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Malbec and even some Carmenere, such as at Chateau Damase. For the white wines, Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon are favored with smaller amounts of Muscadelle, Ugni Blanc, and Sauvignon Gris. Under the strict guidelines of French appellation law for a Bordeaux to be classified as Superieur it must come from a vineyard that is planted more densely. There must be 4,500 plants per hectare with a distance of 2.2 meters between rows, compared to 4,000 plants per hectare with a distance of 2.5 meters between rows for regular Bordeaux. This higher density makes it harder for the plants to survive creating stronger deeper roots, and healthier vines for the ones that do. The regulations also stipulate a lower yield, about 10 percent lower per hectare, which allows each vine to maximize the nutrients received by the grapes that have not been pruned. The grapes must also be picked riper at harvest with higher natural sugar levels resulting in 10 percent natural alcohol level -- a slight bit higher than the 9.5 percent for regular Bordeaux. Bordeaux Superieur can be found anywhere in Bordeaux, but is biased towards the area north of Saint-Emilion and Pomerol. The result of these differences usually creates a superior wine with a richer and more complex flavor.Bordeaux Superieur From Vinovin Online, Retrieved April 17, 2015 === Production and surface === Yearly production: 489,230 hectolitresBordeaux.com: Bordeaux and Bordeaux Superieur: Appellations: Bordeaux Superieur, accessed on 7 November 2010 Surface : == Bordeaux Clairet AOC == Bordeaux clairet is a generic AOC for the Bordeaux defined as "clairet". All other appellations in the Bordeaux region, including the most prestigious ones, are entitled to produce under this AOC. Bordeaux clairet is a wine which can either be described as a dark rose wine or a light-coloured red wine. As there is also a more commonly used Bordeaux rose designation, Bordeaux clairet is not simply any rose from Bordeaux. Bordeaux clairet wines are similar in colour to the wines which were shipped from Bordeaux to England during the Middle Ages, known as French Claret. These wines established the fame of Bordeaux as a wine-making region, and led to the (primarily English) practice of referring to Bordeaux as "claret". They are refreshing wines, appreciated because they can be easily enjoyed with picnics or exotic food. === Production and surface === Yearly production is 52,000 hectolitres from 925 hectares of vineyard surface.Bordeaux.com: Bordeaux and Bordeaux Superieur: Appellations: Bordeaux Clairet, accessed on 5 October 2008 Maximum authorized yield is 55 hectolitres per hectare. === Grape varieties === The authorized grape varieties are the same as red Bordeaux AOC although Merlot is the most common of this AOC. == Summary of characteristics == Production requirements and statistics for the various regional AOCs are as follows: {| class="wikitable" |- bgcolor="lightgrey" !
