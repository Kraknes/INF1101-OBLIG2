He subsequently won a prestigious Department for Education specialist music scholarship to study piano and composition at Wells Cathedral School,https://wells.cathedral.school/composition/ one of the oldest extant schools in the world. At 18 he moved to Los Angeles as assistant to the composer Harry Gregson-Williams, working for him on numerous film scores before branching out to form his own company in 2009. ==Video games== In 2007, he wrote the score for the highly regarded first person shooter Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (with Harry Gregson-Williams). He teamed up with the same developers at their new company Respawn Entertainment to work on the music for Titanfall, an online-only multiplayer shooter. Barton also created the music for the 2016 sequel, Titanfall 2. In 2019 he composed the original music for Titanfall's "battle royale" sibling, Apex Legends, including the now iconic four note theme motif, and has continued to compose over three hours of music for all subsequent seasons of the game. In 2019 he also co-composed the score for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, which won the Society of Composers and Lyricists inaugural award for Best Original Game Score, as well as Music of the Year from G.A.N.G., amongst other awards. ==Film and television== Barton's film work include scores for Unlocked, Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away, Jennifer's Body, Tom Dolby and Tom Williams' debut feature Last Weekend, Line of Fire, Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont and the BAFTA nominated thriller Exam.

Chris Prynoski, the animator behind the hallucination scene in Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, heard Barton's score for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and asked him to score Titmouse's animated series G.I. Joe: Resolute, which led to a further collaboration on a series for Disney, Motorcity.
