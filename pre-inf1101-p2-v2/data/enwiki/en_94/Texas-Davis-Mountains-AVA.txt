The Texas Davis Mountains AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in the Trans-Pecos region of West Texas. Surrounded by the Chihuahuan Desert, the appellation takes advantage of cooler elevation and lower annual rainfall in the Davis Mountains. The land within the boundaries of the AVA ranges between and above sea level. The soil is primarily granitic, porphyritic, and volcanic in nature. The hardiness zones are 7b and 8a. ==Wineries== Only one commercial winery has ever been operated in the Texas Davis Mountains AVA since its creation in 1998: Pleasant Hill Winery. ==See also== * Texas wine ==References== Category:American Viticultural Areas Category:Geography of Texas Category:Texas wine Category:1998 establishments in Texas
