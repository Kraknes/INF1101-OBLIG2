Food Service Solutions, Inc is a software development company based out of Altoona, Pennsylvania that successfully designed and implemented biometrics into a lunchline. Founded in 1989, FSS uses biometric scanning technology to provide services for educational and institutional foodservice providers. The company has established a position of market leadership addressing two problems in school-based foodservice operations. The first is that school children eligible for free or reduce-fee lunches through government assistance programs often fail to participate because of the perceived social stigma associated with showing a special card or meal ticket in front of other students. The second is that in the foodservice POS industry, software has historically been proprietary, cumbersome for clients to self-administer, and difficult to integrate with other technologies. FSS also has a webservice, www.myschoolaccount.com where parents can view what their child has been eating, what their lunch account balance is and also make payments with their credit card or checking/savings account. ==References== Category:Companies based in Blair County, Pennsylvania Category:American companies established in 1989 Category:Software companies based in Pennsylvania Category:Privately held companies based in Pennsylvania Category:1989 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Software companies of the United States Category:1989 establishments in the United States Category:Software companies established in 1989 Category:Companies established in 1989
