The eight foot tall untitled stoneware sculpture from 1985, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, typifies his work from the period. About 1996, he started focusing on salt-fired porcelain figurines which he modeled, rather than carved. The latter are primarily tableaus of many figures engaging in sex or violence. In 2005, he received a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award.
