Troops of the Landstreitkrafte on parade A company of Landstreitkrafte troops on parade in East Berlin, May 1985 The Land Forces of the National People's ArmyDeutsches Institut fur Militargeschichte, Militargeschichte, Vol. XI, Deutscher Militarverlag. 1972. (German: Landstreitkrafte der Nationalen Volksarmee - LaSK), was the ground-based military branch of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) National People's Army (NPA). The Land Forces Command, located at Geltow was established on 1 December 1972 as a management body created for the land forces. The NPA itself was created on March 1, 1956 from the Kasernierte Volkspolizei (Barracked People's Police). == Organisation == Peacetime organisation of the Landstreitkrafte in 1986 The LaSK had a peacetime organisation since 1972 under the command of the Kommando Landstreitkraefte (Kdo. LaSK). Its largest formations between 1956 and 1990 were the Military Districts III and V, which generally consisted of three active divisions each, plus training-, combat support and logistic units. The 1st Motor Rifle Division was additionally attached to the Military District V, but was designated to leave that formation in wartime to play a key role in the assault on West-Berlin. The 6th Motor Rifle Division existed only for two years (1956-1958) as an active formation. While the two districts held the bulk of the GDR's land forces, additional artillery- and support elements, as well as the paratroopers of the 40th Paratrooper Battalion (upgraded to the 40th Air Assault Regiment in 1986) were under direct command of the Kdo. LaSK. In wartime both military districts would have been transformed into armies. The 3rd Army in the South, reinforced by the GDR 6th, 10th, and 17th reserve divisions, and the 5th Army in the North, reinforced by the Soviet 94th Guards Motor Rifle Division and the 138th and 221st independent tank regiments of the Red Army. Both armies would have been commanded by the Soviet high-command, while the Kommando Landstreitkrafte was to focus on the military supply chain, medical services, internal security and assist in the capture of West- Berlin.Rudiger Wenzke:Die Streitkrafte der DDR und Polens in der Operationsplanung des Warschauer Paktes, Militargeschichtliches Forschungsamt, 2010, The order of battle of the ground

event of a full-scale mobilisation, the six regular divisions of the NVA would have been supplemented by three mobilisation divisions and two reserve divisions.Shawn Bohannon Mobilmachungsdivisionen / Reservedivisionen, Axis History Forum, accessed May 2010 All five divisions would be mobilised on M+2. The cadre of each mobilisation/reserve division remained on hand as the regular staff of training centers/non-commissioned officer (NCO) schools. The five second line divisions were the 6th Motor Rifle Division (Konigswartha), the 10th Motor Rifle Division (Ronneburg), the 17th Motor Rifle Division (HQ Petersroda), the 19th Motor Rifle Division (HQ Wulkow, which was not based on a training centre), and the 20th Motor Rifle Division (HQ Bredenfelde).

The structure and equipment was mostly of Soviet design, and the NVA operated in close collaboration with the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. There were also reports of a special NVA diversionary battalion in south Germany equipped with M-48s and M-113s, able to cause confusion amongst NATO forces if war came (thus emulating and improving on the example of Otto Skorzeny's 150th Panzer Brigade during the Ardennes Offensive). However more recent reports throw doubt on the existence of any such unit.Steven J. Zaloga and James Loop, Soviet Bloc Elite Forces, Osprey Publishing, 1998, had the initial report of the battalion, more recent critical commentary is at Tanknet > NVA Special Units ==Types of units== Divisions *Motorisierte-Schutzen- Division (motorised/mechanised infantry division) *Panzerdivision (tank/armoured division) Regiments *Artillerieregiment (artillery regiment) *Panzerregiment (tank/armoured regiment) *Ersatzregiment (replacement regiment) *Fla-Raketen Regiment (AA-missile regiment) *Mot.-Schutzenregiment (motor rifle/mechanised infantry regiment) Battalions *Aufklarungsbatallion (reconnaissance battalion) *Battalion Chemische Abwehr (chemical defence battalion) *Battalion Materielle Sicherstellung (logistical security battalion) *Instandsetzungsbatallion (repair battalion) *Nachrichtenbatallion (signal battalion) *Pionierbatallion (engineer battalion) *Sanitatsbatallion (medical battalion) Detachments *Panzerjagerabteilung (light AT detachment) *Raketenabteilung (rocket detachment) *Geschosswerferabteilung (heavy mortar detachment) Artist's rendering of a T-34-85 in service with the Landstreitkrafte BTR-70s on parade in East Berlin, 1989 A T-55AM2B on display at the Panzermuseum in Munster A T-55A at the Panzermuseum A former Landstreitkrafte ZIL-135 truck configured as a FROG-7B (Luna-M) missile system, displayed in the Hameenlinna Artillery Museum ==Equipment== Small Arms: {| class="wikitable" style="width:75%;" |- ! style="width:15%;"| Name ! style="width:25%;"| Country of origin ! style="width:15%;"| Type ! style="width:20%;"| Notes |- | Walther PP | || Semi-automatic pistol || |- | Makarov PM | || Semi-automatic pistol || |- |Nagant M1895 || || |Revolver |Imported in small numbers and saw little use |- | PPSh-41 | || Submachine gun || |- | FB PM-63 | || Submachine gun || |- | Mauser Kar98k | || Bolt action rifle || In use by the Combat Groups of the Working Class and remained in standard use until the 1960s and continued its service in limited circumstances |- | Mosin-Nagant | || Bolt action rifle || In use by the Combat Groups of the Working Class and in remained standard use until the 1960s and continued its service in limited circumstances |- |STG44 | || Assault rifle ||Left over from World War II, used until the early 1960s |- | SKS | || Semi-automatic carbine ||Used in ceremonies and when marching in parades |- | AKM | || Assault rifle || Manufactured by the state arsenal as the MPi-KM (fixed stock, later variants were distinctive stippled plastic) and MPi-KMS-72 (AKMS) with a single strut "coathanger" side-folding stock |- | AK-74 | || Assault rifle || MPi-AK-74N, MPi-AKS-74N, MPi-AKS-74NK variants made by the state arsenal for a short period of time starting in 1983 (withdrawn from service after German reunification) |- | RPD | || Light machine gun || |- | RPK | || Light machine gun || |- | PKM | || General-purpose machine gun || |- | Dragunov SVD | || Designated marksman rifle || |- | RPG-7D | || Light AT-weapon || |- | RPG-18 | || Light AT-weapon || |} Armoured Vehicles: {| class="wikitable" style="width:75%;" |- ! style="width:15%;"| Name ! style="width:25%;"| Country of origin ! style="width:15%;"| Type ! style="width:20%;"| Quantity !
