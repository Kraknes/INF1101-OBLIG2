Lutfu'llah Hakim (1888 - 1968) was a prominent Baha'i who served on the International Baha'i Council and Universal House of Justice, the supreme governing body of the Baha'i Faith. Lutfu'llah Hakim was born in 1888 in Iran to a prominent Baha'i family. His paternal grandfather, Hakim Masih, was the court physician for the Qajar dynasty and the first Jewish convert to the Baha'i Faith. When Lutfu'llah Hakim's father, Hakim Sulayman died, Lutfu'llah was placed under the care of his elder brother, Dr. Arastu Khan. On September 4, 1911, while studying physiotherapy in London, Hakim was among the Baha'is who greeted `Abdu'l-Baha during his visit to Great Britain. During this period, Hakim was close friends with John Esslemont, who would go on to become a Baha'i in 1915. `Abdu'l-Baha would dedicate several Tablets to Hakim and eventually summoned him to Haifa to serve there. In 1920, `Abdu'l-Baha sent Hakim to England with Shoghi Effendi to accompany him on his journey. By the time of `Abdu'l-Baha's death on November 28, 1921, Hakim had returned to Haifa. In 1924 he went to Iran to work in Susan Moody's clinic. In 1951, Shoghi Effendi called him to Haifa and appointed him to the International Baha'i Council. In 1963, Lutfu'llah Hakim was elected as an inaugural member of the Universal House of Justice, on which body he served until asking to retire in 1967 due to ill health. He died in 1968. He is buried in the Baha'i Cemetery, Haifa, Israel.
