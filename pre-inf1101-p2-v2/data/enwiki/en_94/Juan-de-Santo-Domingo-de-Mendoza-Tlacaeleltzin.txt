Don Juan de Santo Domingo de Mendoza Tlacaeleltzin Chichimeca teuctli (died 1563) was the tlatoani (ruler) of Itztlacozauhcan in Amaquemecan, Chalco from 1548 to 1563. Don Juan's father, don Tomas de San Martin Quetzalmazatzin, had been the previous tlatoani of Itztlacozauhcan, having been installed there by Hernan Cortes. His mother was Quetzalpetlatzin, don Tomas's first wife, who (according to Chimalpahin) was a Mexica noblewoman, the daughter of Tlilpotoncatzin, cihuacoatl of Tenochtitlan, thus making don Juan the great grandson of the cihuacoatl Tlacaelel, his namesake. He had two sons, don Diego and don Pedro. Don Juan died in 1563. In 1564 his half-brother don Gregorio de los Angeles Tepoztlixayacatzin succeeded him as tlatoani. ==References== * * Category:1563 deaths Category:Tlatoque Category:Year of birth unknown
