She remarried to a taxi driver, Florentin Bremont, who died in 1967. She had no children. Over the course of her life, she worked as a farmer, a nanny, a seamstress, and in a pharmaceutical factory. At 103, she was hit by a car and broke her arm as a result. She died at a retirement home in Cande, Maine-et-Loire. === Germaine Haye === Germaine Haye (nee Germain; 10 October 1888 - 18 April 2002) was France's oldest living person for about a year, following the death of Marie Bremont on 6 June 2001 until her own death at age 113 years 190 days."113-jahrige Franzosin in Seniorenheim verstorben", (""113-year-old Frenchwoman dies in retirement home"), ShortNews.de, 2002-04-19. Retrieved 2007-11-11. She was also the oldest living person in Europe and fourth oldest in the world. Haye lived in the town of Mortagne-au- Perche in Orne, Normandy, western France, since she was 19 years old. She worked as a babysitter and a teacher until her three daughters grew up and left home. She then devoted herself to literature, publishing poems under the pseudonym Anne Moranget. In 2000, after she fractured her femur, she was confined to a wheelchair, and went to live in the Mortagne-au-Perche retirement home for the final two years of her life. She died in her sleep. === Camille Loiseau === Camille Blanche Loiseau (13 February 1892 - 12 August 2006) was the oldest living person in France until her death aged 114 years 180 days. Loiseau was ranked fifth-oldest in the world in the 2007 edition of Guinness World Records. She was the oldest person ever to share a birthday with another living person, Japanese supercentenarian Toyo Endo. Loiseau was born in Paris, the youngest of nine children, four boys and five girls. On 13 August 1910 she married Rene Frederic Chadal, but divorced fifteen days later. She never married again, and had no children of her own, but helped raise her nephews. She worked as an accountant until 1957. She was hospitalised in 1998 due to a fall, and moved permanently to the Hopital Paul-Brousse in Villejuif, Val-de-Marne, in January 1999. In 2002, she was taken on a trip to see her native Paris again. She died in the hospital, six months after her one-hundred and fourteenth birthday, which she had celebrated "with a little champagne". === Marie-Simone Capony === Marie-Simone Capony (14 March 1894 - 15 September 2007) was, at age 113, the oldest living person in France. She became the French doyenne following the death of 114-year-old Camille Loiseau in August 2006. At the time of her death, aged 113 years and 185 days, due to heart failure, she ranked as the fifth-oldest person in the world. Capony was born in Charlieu (Loire), and lived in a retirement facility in Cannes. She never married as her fiance was killed in action at the beginning of the First World War in 1914. Capony was not able to walk since she turned 100, following surgery on a broken femur, but she still remained in fairly good health considering her age. === Marie-Isabelle Diaz === Marie-Isabelle Diaz (nee Rodriguez, 22 February 1898 - 29 October 2011) was posthumously recognised as the oldest living French person from the death of Eugenie Blanchard on 4 November 2010, until her own death a year later.

She was 113 years 249 days old when she died. === Mathilde Aussant === Mathilde Aussant (nee Gaudet, 27 February 1898 - 23 July 2011) was, at the time of her death, believed to be the oldest verified person in France. However, she was later deemed the second oldest, when Marie-Isabelle Diaz was verified to have been born a few days earlier than her, on 22 February 1898. Aussant was born in Donges, France, the fifth of eleven children born to Francois Gaudet and Helene Halgand. Following the death of her mother, she left Donges for Paris in 1923.

She died at a hospital in Vendome on Saturday, 23 July 2011, aged 113 years, 146 days. ===Lucile Randon=== Lucile Randon was born in Ales, on 11 February 1904. She worked as a gouvernante in various families, and became a religious sister at age 41. She worked in a hospital in Vichy for 31 years, then moved to a nursing home in Haute-Savoie for 30 years, and finally to Toulon since 2009. She is known by her religious name Soeur Andre.
