Thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TR-alpha) also known as nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group A, member 1 (NR1A1), is a nuclear receptor protein that in humans is encoded by the THRA gene. == Function == The protein encoded by this gene is a nuclear hormone receptor for triiodothyronine. It is one of the several receptors for thyroid hormone, and has been shown to mediate the biological activities of thyroid hormone. Knockout studies in mice suggest that the different receptors, while having certain extent of redundancy, may mediate different functions of thyroid hormone. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported. == Interactions == THR1 has been shown to interact with: * COPS2, * EP300, * ITGB3BP, * MED1, * MED6, * MED12, * MED16, * MEF2A, * NCOA6, * TRIP11, and * UBC. == References == == Further reading == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Intracellular receptors Category:Transcription factors
