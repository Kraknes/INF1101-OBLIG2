Tongli Publishing Co. (Chinese: Dong Li Chu Ban She , Hanyu Pinyin: Dong Li Chubanshe), most known as Tong Li Comics, is a publishing company which distributes a variety of domestic and imported comics in Taiwan. ==History== Tong Li Publishing head office in "State Capital Economic and Trade Building"(Shou Fu Jing Mao Da Sha ) Tong Li was founded in Tainan, Taiwan in 1977 with a mere nine employees."Tong Li Publishing Timeline (Dong Li Chu Ban Nian Jian )", Tong Li, Retrieved 2008-10-13. Tong Li entered the publishing business as a seller of illegally copied comic books. "For fifteen years, Tong Li was the largest producer of pirated comics, redoing more than 1,000 titles in all, and for part of that time, fifty a month."John A. Lent, Pulp Demons: International Dimensions of the Postwar Anti-Comics Campaign (1999) p. 195. Tong Li's original method of operation was to procure new comics from Japanese distributors, replacing the Japanese text with traditional Chinese, and "drawing bras on bare-breasted women characters and modifying, up to what they could get away with, explicitly sexual or violent panels".Pulp Demons, p. 195. The head of Tong Li, Fang Wan-nan(Fan Wan Nan ), "jokingly referred to himself as the 'king of pirated comics'". Despite the copyright violation trend, Tong Li procured Taiwan's first legal license for Japanese manga with Minako Narita's Cipher from Hakusensha in 1989, and followed with Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira from Kodansha in 1991. A 1992 Taiwanese law strengthening the copyright enforcement of comics forced Tong Li to abandon the copying and develop original content in addition to acquiring licenses through legal means, at which point it began publishing the magazines Dragon Youth (Long Shao Nian Yue Kan ) and StarGirls (Xing Shao Nu Yue Kan ) - titles which retained the considerable influence of Japanese manga. It currently releases over 100 licensed manga titles a month includes One Piece, Bleach, Naruto, Sket Dance, Hunter x Hunter, Gintama, Shijo Saikyo no Deshi Ken'ichi, Skip Beat, and more. ==Manga Magazines published by Tong Li Publishing== *Dragon Youth Comic *New Youth Express *New Youth Express Monthly *Formosa Youth *Young Flower *Star Girls *New Youth Weekly ==See also== * List of companies of Taiwan ==References== ==External links== * Category:Mass media companies of Taiwan Category:Comic book publishing companies of China Category:Manhua distributors Category:Publishing companies established in 1977 Category:1977 establishments in Taiwan Category:Manga distributors
