In enzymology, an anthranilate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :chorismate + L-glutamine \rightleftharpoons anthranilate + pyruvate + L-glutamate 2 Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are chorismate and L-glutamine, whereas its 3 products are anthranilate, pyruvate, and L-glutamate. ==Function== ==Reaction== In enzymology, an anthranilate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction : chorismate + L-glutamine \rightleftharpoons anthranilate + pyruvate + L-glutamate Chemical equation of reaction occurring in anthranilate synthase Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are chorismate and L-glutamine, whereas its 3 products are anthranilate, pyruvate, and L-glutamate. ==Structure and assembly== The complex is made up of a and b subunits. Gel filtration experiments reveal that the complex occurs as an a2b2 tetramer under native conditions, and as an ab dimer under high salt concentrations. The ab dimers interact through the a subunits to form the complex. ==Homologs== ==Paralogs== ==Nomenclature== This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, to be specific the oxo-acid-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is chorismate pyruvate-lyase (amino-accepting; anthranilate- forming). Other names in common use include anthranilate synthetase, chorismate lyase, and chorismate pyruvate-lyase (amino-accepting). This enzyme participates in phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis and two- component system - general. ==Structural studies== As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and . ==Application== ==References== * * * * * Category:EC 4.1.3 Category:Enzymes of known structure Category:Anthranilates
