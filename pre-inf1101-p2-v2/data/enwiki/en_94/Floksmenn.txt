Floksmenn is a folktale from the Faroe Islands. The story centers on the easternmost village of Hattarvik on Fugloy during the Middle Ages. The tale of the Floksmenn is of a flok or group of rebels. The most notorious of the rebels, (as the Danish governmental and officials in Torshavn referred to them) were Hogni Nev, Rogvi Skel, Halvdan Ulvsson and Sjurdur vid Kellingara from the village of Hattarvik. These men controlled and savaged the northern parts of the Faroe Islands for a long time. This is one of the most important separatist tales of the Faroe Islands. The more intelligent Sjurdur vid Kellingara was forced to go the more militant way of rebellion by Hogni Nev and Halvdan Ulvsson, who were more criminally-minded than Sjurdur vid kellingara. All four men were later caught and sentenced to death, but Sjurdur vid kellingara was shown mercy and granted amnesty. The story is that he could not live with the crimes that he and the others had committed under their "little" rebellion and asked to be executed with the other floksmenn. ==Other sources== *Hammershaimb Venceslaus Ulricus and Jakobsen, Jakob (1886) Faerosk Anthologi (Kobenhavn, S.L.
