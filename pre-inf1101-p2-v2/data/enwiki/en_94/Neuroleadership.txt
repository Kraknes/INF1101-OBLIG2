The term neuroleadership was first coined by David Rock in 2006 in the US publication Strategy+Business. In 2009 Mark Waldman developed a NeuroLeadership class that is part of the Executive MBA program at Loyola Marymount University. Neuroleadership claims to bring neuroscientific knowledge into the areas of leadership development, management training, change management, education, consulting and coaching. ==Criticism== Neuroleadership is not without its critics.See for example comments by Howard Gardner and Warren Bennis in Australian Financial Review 9 November 2007 They question whether having scientific brain data to back up what was commonly believed adds any value. ==References== * ==Further reading== * * * * ==External links== * * Neuroleadership training and development: Integral Performance, The Tuscan Leadership Institute.
