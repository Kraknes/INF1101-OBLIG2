WOEL-FM (89.9 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a Religious format in Elkton, Maryland. The station is currently owned by Maranatha Bible Institute, Inc (now known as Maryland Baptist Bible College). WOEL signed on in 1978 on 88.3 MHz. Due to interference with WPVI Channel 6 in Philadelphia, WOEL was moved to 89.9 MHz in 1983. WOEL aired many programs produced by Bob Jones University, as well as programs like "The Gospel Hour" with Oliver B. Greene, "The Bright Spot Hour" with Harold Sightler and "The People's Gospel Hour" with Perry Rockwood and "Unshackled" from the Pacific Garden Mission. Live church services were also broadcast from the Maranatha Baptist Church in Elkton, Maryland. The music is conservative and traditional. In the 1980s, WOEL was rebroadcast on two translators, one in Waynesboro, Pennsylvania and one in Easton, Maryland on 90.7 MHz. Both translators are now off the air. The transmitter is located at the corner of the Old Elk Neck Road and Jones Chapel Road, southwest of Elkton. ==External links== * * * OEL-FM Category:Elkton, Maryland OEL-FM
