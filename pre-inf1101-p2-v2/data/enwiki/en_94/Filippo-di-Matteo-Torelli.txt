Filippo di Matteo Torelli (active 1440-1468) was an Italian painter and illuminator. He was a Florentine miniaturist. In the Laurentian library in Florence there is a finely illuminated Evangelistarium by him, with miniatures of the Adoration of the Kings, the Crucifixion, the Resurrection. In conjunction with Zanobi Strozzi, he illuminated some choir books for the Duomo and for San Marco, in Florence. These miniatures were in one time wrongly attributed to Fra Benedetto, the brother of Fra Angelico. ==References== * Category:Quattrocento painters Category:Italian male painters Category:15th- century Italian painters Category:Florentine painters Category:1440 births Category:1468 deaths Category:Manuscript illuminators
