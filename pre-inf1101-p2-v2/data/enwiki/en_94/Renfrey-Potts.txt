Renfrey Burnard (Ren) Potts AO (1925-2005) was an Australian mathematician and is notable for the Potts model and his achievements in: operations research, especially networks; transportation science, car-following and road traffic; Ising-type models in mathematical physics; difference equations; and robotics. He was interested in computing from the early days of the computing revolution and oversaw the first computer purchases at the University of Adelaide. ==Personal== The fourth child of Gilbert MacDonald Potts and Lorna Potts (nee West), named after family friend and medical doctor Renfrey Gershom Burnard, Potts was educated at Rose Park Primary School and Prince Alfred College, where his father was Second Master. Potts was an outstanding lecturer who drew large audiences to his talks. In addition to mathematics, he was interested in sports and music. His sporting activities included long distance and marathon running, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton, bushwalking, and swimming. He played both the piano and the clarinet and was a volunteer disc jockey at a local radio station. He married Barbara KidmanDr Barbara Kidman was a senior lecturer in computer science at the University of Adelaide. After graduating in 1949 with first class Honours in Physics ("the first woman to do so" (Presumably, the first woman at the University of Adelaide.)), she devoted 6 years to full-time research at the Oxford University before returning to Adelaide and being awarded a PhD in 1956 ("one of the first two women to achieve this" (Again, presumably, the first at the University of Adelaide.)). Following a 9-year interruption, Dr Kidman returned to work in 1966 in what was then the very new field of computing and completed 20 years of work in this industry before retiring in 1987. Dr Kidman's publications include "Paper tape and punched cards: The early history of computing and computing science at the University of Adelaide", 1999, . in Oxford on 1 July 1950. They had two daughters, Linda and Rebecca. They also had four grandchildren, Frank, Zoe, Jack and Georgia. ==Summary== *1925 Born: 4 October 1925 Adelaide, South Australia, Australia *1930-1936 Rose Park Primary School *1937-1942 Prince Alfred College *1943-1947 University of Adelaide Bachelor of Science (First class honours in mathematics) *1948 Rhodes Scholar, Queen's College, OxfordList of South Australian Rhodes Scholars *1949 Barbara Kidman graduated with first class Honours in Physics *1949-1951 D Phil, (Oxford), Dissertation: The Mathematical Investigation of Some Cooperative Phenomena, Advisor: Cyril DombCyril Domb, Mathematics Genealogy Project *1950 Married Barbara Kidman in Oxford on 1 July 1950 *1951-1957 Lecturer in Mathematics at the University of Adelaide *1955-1956 Postdoctoral Scientist at the University of Maryland, USA *1956 Barbara Kidman awarded a PhD *1957-1959 Associate Professor at the University of Toronto in Canada *1958-1959 Consultant to General Motors in Detroit *1959 Awarded the Lanchester Prize for research in operations research *1959 Appointed to a newly created chair in applied mathematics at the University of Adelaide *1959-1990 Professor, Chair and popular lecturer of applied mathematics at the University of Adelaide *1966 Dr Kidman returns to workforce as lecturer in the (then) new area of Computer Science *1968 Doctor of Science (DSc) received from the University of Oxford *1975 fellow of the Australian Academy of Science (FAA) *1976 Appointed (Sir Thomas) Elder Professor of Mathematics * Foundation President of the South Australian Computer Society (the forerunner of the Australian Computer Society).
