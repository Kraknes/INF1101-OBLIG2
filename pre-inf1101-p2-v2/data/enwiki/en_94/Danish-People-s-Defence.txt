The Danish People's Defence (Danish: Dansk Folke Vaern or Dansk Folkevaern) was the civilian arm of the Danish Schalburg Corps active from April 1943 to August 1944, in support of the German occupation of Denmark. It was made up of civilians, some of whom were expected to provide financial backing. The founding of Dansk Folkevaern commenced in April 1943, with Knud Borge Martinsen among the first Dansk Folkevaern leaders.Alkil ed. (1945), pp.591, available online at kasler-journal.dk/Fakta10.htm Dansk Folkevaern functioned as the political propaganda arm of the Schalburg Corps, and was open to both men and women.Alkil ed. (1945), pp.577, available online at kasler- journal.dk/Fakta09.htm Dansk Folkevaern was formally working independently of the Schalburg Corps, though they shared the same address, and Dansk Folkevaern was described by one of its leaders as "Schalburg Corps' Group II". Many of Frits Clausen's former supporters in the National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark (DNSAP) were recruited. For example, a group led by Max Arildskov called Landstormen, which had broken away from the DNSAP after Clausen's poor results in the March 1943 election. In December, Arildskov put his men at the disposal of the Schalburg Corps as regular soldiers, but only around 50 were accepted. The others were put into the Danish People's Defence. In May 1944, DNSAP banned all DNSAP members who were also active in Dansk Folkevaern, Landstormen, Schalburg Corps, among other groups.Alkil ed. (1945), pp.420, available online at kasler-journal.dk/Fakta07.htm In August 1944, Dansk Folkevaern was disbanded, and the members went on to join Dansk National Samling. ==Sources== * ==References== Category:Danish collaborators with Nazi Germany
