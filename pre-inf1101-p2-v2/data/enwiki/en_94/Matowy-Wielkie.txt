Matowy Wielkie (formerly German Gross Montau) is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Miloradz, within Malbork County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northern Poland. It lies approximately west of Miloradz, west of Malbork, and south of the regional capital Gdansk. The village has a population of 353. The town was, in 1347, the birthplace of Saint Dorothea of Montau. Thus, a 14th-century Gothic church is located in the village which is located close to the Malbork Castle (Ordensburg Marienburg), the then the capital of the Teutonic Order's monastic state. Before 1772 the area was part of Kingdom of Poland, 1772-1919 Prussia and Germany, 1920-1939 Free City of Danzig, September 1939 - February 1945 Nazi Germany. In 1945 returned to Poland.
