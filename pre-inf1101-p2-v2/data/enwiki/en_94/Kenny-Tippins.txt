Kenneth Tippins, (born July 22, 1966 in Adel, Georgia) is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys and Atlanta Falcons. He played college football at Middle Tennessee State University. ==Early years== Tippins attended Cook High School, where he practiced football and basketball.

He finished his career with 151 tackles (20 for loss) and 9 sacks. In 1990 after playing his first NFL season, he returned to school to work on his Physical Education degree at a time when the basketball team was left with only 3 active players, after suspensions were handed down following a bench-clearing brawl against Tennessee Tech University.
