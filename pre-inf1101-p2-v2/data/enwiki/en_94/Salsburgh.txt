Salsburgh is a semi rural former coal mining village in greenbelt farmland within the district of North Lanarkshire, Scotland. The closest major town to the village is Shotts to the south east and Airdrie to the north west. Salsburgh is perhaps best known for the Kirk O' Shott's Church (affectionately known as "The M8 Church") which sits on a hillock and is fairly visible as visitors enter the village from the east on the B7066 Whitburn to Newhouse road. There has been a community in the area for over 600 years, although the present village dates back to 1729. At that time only a row of four houses existed, named "Muirhall, Girdhimstrait, Merchanthall and Craighead". Craighead was home to a Mr. Young and his wife Sally, and when Young sold some of his land to construct more houses it was decided that it would be named "Sallysburgh". Through time the name was shortened to Salsburgh. Streets around the village are named after significant natives from its past relating to industry, mining, farming and agriculture all of which are part of the village's rich tapestry and make-up. Salsburgh has various scenic walks, picturesque views for miles and areas which have remained untampered with by man such as the Riven Loch where much wildlife can be discovered. The village is also well known and publicised as being rich in folklore, stories and tales of a giant (see Bertram de Shotts, a haunted cemetery Shottskirk and a mysterious grey figure purported to be a lady are well published on the internet and indeed one caller to a local late night call in talk show on the now defunct Scot FM made a distressed call to the show stating they had just hit a mysterious grey figure, but upon going to make sure they were ok, the individual had just simply vanished into thin air. ==Coal mining== ===Duntilland=== Duntilland Colliery began production in 1896 with a workforce of just under 200.

It officially opened in 1799. Due to an increase in school roll the original school was deemed no longer viable. A new school was built to the east end of the village and was opened in August 1912 as Shottskirk Public School,Shottskirk Public School which later reverted to its original roots as Kirk O' Shott's in 1958 as a junior / secondary school. Kirk O' Shott's Public School still thrives today as a busy public primary school serving the local community of Salsburgh and surrounding hamlets and proudly celebrated its centenary on 12 August 2012. Kirk O' Shott's remains a public school open to all denominations. ===Kirk O' Shott's (Shottskirk) Parish Church=== Kirk O' Shott's Parish Church is the name of the local church which serves the parish of Salsburgh, Shotts and surrounding area. The church was formerly a Catholic place of worship under the name St. Catherines, taken from Catherine of Sienna. About 550 years ago Bothwell and Shotts formed one parish which stretched from the Clyde to Linlithgowshire, and from the North to the South Calder. In this large area there were four places of worship, one of which was situated in the middle Bothwellmuir at "a desert place called Bertram-Shotts". Bertram was reputed to be a giant who lived in the area and terrorised travellers on the Glasgow/Edinburgh road. A reward was offered for his capture - dead or alive - and was claimed by William Muirhead who lay in wait for Bertram when the latter came to his favourite drinking place, a spring of water on the hillside above Shottsburn. He hamstrung him and, as the giant lay laughing up at him, he cut off his head with the words, "Will ye laugh-up yet?" It was on Bertram's plot of land that St. Catherine's Chapel was built in 1450. It was dedicated to "the blessed Virgin and Catherine of Sienna". After the Reformation of 1560, Kirk o'Shotts, otherwise known as Shottskirk or the affectionately titled "M8 Church", became a Protestant place of worship. The old church of St Catherine's must have suffered many changes and required frequent changes since its foundation, but of these there is no account before 1640. In that year the Presbytery met at Shotts and ordered that the church be repaired and partly rebuilt, but it was more than eight years before the work was completed. The site of the old church is marked by the headstone erected to Samuel Meuros, who was session clerk and school master from 1794 to 1837. He was also Precentor, and it was his wish to be buried where his old desk had stood; thus he lies still at his post. On the back of the stone is the following inscription: "Here stood the Precentor's desk in the Kirk of Bertram Shotts which was rebuilt and extended in 1642". This stone and the burial ground of the Inglises of Murdoston, which was inside the old church, give a clear idea of the site. Shottskirk Cemetery is reported to be haunted by a mysterious grey figure who vanished to and from the mist when a driver reported having hit a grey figure on the B7066 road which runs adjacent to the Church and graveyard. ===St. Catherine's Well / "Kate's Well"=== St. Catherine's Well or "Kate's Well" is a natural holy spring well on holy ground at the foot of Kirk O'Shott's Parish Church, otherwise known as Shottskirk, in the village of Salsburgh, North Lanarkshire. The well dates back to the 14th century and derives from the church's former past when it was a Catholic place of worship as St. Catherines Chapel which has origins from Catherine of Sienna. Kate's Well was also the scene of the local legendary giant Bertram de Shotts' demise where his head was decapitated as he drank from the well. ===Skate Park=== In November 2019 it was announced that through successful campaigning thanks to the local community council, funding would be released for a new skate park, this will be located to the most eastward (bottom end) side of the King George Fifth park off Main Street and Jock's Road. ===Miner Statue=== In November 2019 it was also announced along with the new skate park, would be a new miner statue to commemorate the villages rich mining history. The statue location is being narrowed down to one of two locations, the first being the Jubilee Garden next to the community centre or the second being next to one of the village welcome gateways where it would be seen more prominently. ===The Transmitters=== Salsburgh is the locale of the twin BlackHill Transmitters due to its high position towering above the M8 motorway opposite the church. They can be seen as far as Bathgate, West Lothian to the east and Glasgow to the west. The transmitters are quite a prominent feature after dark for miles around, due to the coloured red lights which prevent aircraft from striking the towers. The Kirk o'Shotts transmitting station is also nearby, which formerly carried a TV service and today carries DAB radio. ===Pre-fabricated buildings=== Salsburgh was one of the first places in Scotland to have a "pre-fab", a pre-fabricated building with corrugated steel walls built. The first ever pre-fab was built in the village in 1945.http://www.salsburghheritagegroup.co.uk/images/First-Prefab.jpg?951 ===Schools and nurseries=== *Kirk O' Shott's Primary School (public, non- denominational) *Rowantree Nursery / Kirk O' Shott's Nursery ===Places of worship=== *Kirk O' Shott's Parish Church (Protestant) *Sacred Heart R.C Chapel (Catholic) *Salsburgh Gospel Hall (Christian) ==Geography== ===Climate=== Salsburgh has an oceanic climate (Koppen: Cfb). ==Homes== Throughout the years there have been a variety of mixed styles of properties in the village, beginning with prefabs (prefabricated structures with tin roofs) which were then replaced with more substantial council authority brick- built homes. The village today consists of detached, semi-detached, terraced, bungalows, cottages, miners' row cottages (most of which are council authority and/or privately owned former local authority properties) and also fully renovated former derelict properties and new builds such as Salsburgh Meadows and the new builds situated in sections of Main Street. The mix of old (miners' rows) and new (Salsburgh Meadows) makes the village quaint and gives it a certain charm retaining the old buildings from years gone by. Salsburgh is one of the only places in North Lanarkshire that does not have a gas main, as it was not cost effective when the pipes were being laid. Services are provided independently by oil/LPG and, surprisingly, coal suppliers. Most if not all street names within the village have some significance to the village's history and/or former residents. ==Landmarks== * Kirk O' Shott's Parish Church: 'The M8 Church' * Blackhill Transmitters Other landmarks include the footbridge which crosses the B7066 main road, which was struck by a careless crane driver in 2009.
