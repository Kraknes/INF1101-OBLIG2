The rector of the University of Oslo is the university's highest officer, who serves as both its chief executive, its ceremonial head and as chairperson of the university board. The rector is directly elected among the (full) professors by all the members of the university community, that is academic employees, students and technical-administrative staff, who received the right to vote in this order. Until 1989, only professors were eligible to stand for election, although so far all rectors have been professors at the university. The rector's deputy and the university's second highest official, the pro- rector, is also directly elected at the same time. Both the rector and the pro-rector are elected for four-year terms and may stand for reelection to the same office once. The rectorate may also include one or more appointed vice- rectors, who rank below both the rector and the pro-rector. The rectorate forms the university's senior leadership and has the overall responsibility for the management of the university; they are assisted by the director of the university, who heads the technical-administrative staff, but who is subordinate to the rectorate (the rector, pro-rector and vice-rectors). The office of rector was instituted by law in 1905, and made effective in 1907. From 1845 to 1907, the Collegium academicum, the highest body of the university, elected a chairman among its members to serve for one year. From 1814 to 1845, the university had a Chancellor, which was only a ceremonial office held by the Lord Lieutenant (stattholder), and a Pro-Chancellor, who was the deputy of the Chancellor and ex officio chairman of the Collegium academicum. ==Chancellors, 1814-1844== {| class="wikitable" |- !
