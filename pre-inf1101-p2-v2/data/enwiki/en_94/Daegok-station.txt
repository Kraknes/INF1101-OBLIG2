Daegok Station is a station on the Ilsan Line and the Gyeongui-Jungang Line. It is located in the city of Goyang, close to Ilsan. It is mainly used as a transfer station between the two lines rather than as an actual enter-and-exit stop, as the station is located in the midst of farmland with very little local resident demand. It will host a third line for transfer in the future, as the Seohae Line will be built and brought northward around 2021. This will allow for much faster, direct subway travel between Ilsan, Gimpo Airport, Bucheon, Siheung, and Ansan. ==Vicinity== *Exit 1: Neunggok Elementary School *Exit 5: Daegok Elementary School == References == ==External links== * Station information from Korail Category:Railway stations opened in 1996 Category:Seoul Metropolitan Subway stations Category:Metro stations in Goyang Category:Seoul Subway Line 3 Category:Gyeongui Line Category:Gyeongui-Jungang Line Category:1996 establishments in South Korea
