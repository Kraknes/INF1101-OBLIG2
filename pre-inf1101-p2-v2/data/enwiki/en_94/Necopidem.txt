Necopidem is a drug in the imidazopyridine family, which is related to the better known drugs zolpidem and alpidem. It is therefore considered a nonbenzodiazepine and as such may have sedative and anxiolytic effects, given its structural similarity to other nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics. == References == Category:Carboxamides Category:GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators Category:Imidazopyridines Category:Sedatives
