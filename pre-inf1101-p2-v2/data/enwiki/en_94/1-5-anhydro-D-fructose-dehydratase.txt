In enzymology, a 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :1,5-anhydro-D-fructose \rightleftharpoons 1,5-anhydro-4-deoxy-D-glycero-hex-3-en-2-ulose + HO Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose, and two products, 1,5-anhydro-4-deoxy-D- glycero-hex-3-en-2-ulose and HO. It catalyzes two steps in the anhydrofructose pathway process.IUBMB - Anhydrofructose Pathway This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose hydro-lyase (ascopyrone-M-forming). Other names in common use include 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose 4-dehydratase, 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose hydrolyase, 1,5-anhydro-D-arabino-hex-2-ulose dehydratase, AFDH, AF dehydratase, and 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose hydro-lyase. ==References== * * * == See also == * Anhydrofructose pathway * Ascopyrone tautomerase * exo-(1-4)-a-D-glucan lyase Category:EC 4.2.1 Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
