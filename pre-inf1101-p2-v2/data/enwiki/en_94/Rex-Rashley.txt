Rex Rashley (1894-1972) was a British character actor who appeared regularly on The Morecambe & Wise Show (1968) often dressed in familiar stars' attire as part of a joke. For instance, he appeared in cowboy hat, spurs and sheriff's star on stage, with Morecambe advising Wise that he was "John Wayne's Son" - the joke being that Rashley was elderly and clearly several years older than Wayne himself. ==External links== * Category:British male television actors Category:Morecambe and Wise Category:1894 births Category:1972 deaths Category:20th-century British comedians
