One of Yoo's photos caught the eye of Chen Yu-shan (producer for the Taiwanese drama My Lucky Star) from a magazine she picked up while at a beauty salon. Chen made arrangements afterwards with Yoo's agent to fly Yoo from South Korea to Taiwan to audition for My Lucky Star, which landed Yoo the lead female role in that drama. At the time, Yoo had already appeared in the music video "White Windmill" for Taiwanese singer Jay Chou. Yoo went on to appear in a few Taiwanese films such as Exit No. 6 before returning to South Korea, where she starred in TV dramas such as My Too Perfect Sons, First Wives' Club, and Paradise Ranch.
