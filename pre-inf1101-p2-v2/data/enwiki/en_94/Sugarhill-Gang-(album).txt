Sugarhill Gang is the self-titled debut album by influential rap group The Sugarhill Gang. ==Reception== The album was released in 1980 for Sugarhill Records and was produced by Sylvia Robinson. The single "Rapper's Delight" was the first rap single to become a Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching #36 on the U.S. pop chart and #4 on the R&B; chart. Although "Rapper's Delight" was the only charting single, the album also included the minor hit, "Rapper's Reprise". The remainder of the LP consists of several down-tempo soul tracks and a disco instrumental, as Sylvia Robinson did not believe an album consisting entirely of hip hop music would be commercially viable in 1980. ==Track listing== #"Here I Am" - 5:09 (Craig Derry, Nate Edmonds) #"Rapper's Reprise (Jam-Jam)" (ft.
