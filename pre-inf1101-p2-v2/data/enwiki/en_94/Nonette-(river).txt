The Nonette is a tributary to the river Oise in northern France. It is long. Its source is in Nanteuil-le-Haudouin, from which it flows west through Senlis and Chantilly, and joins the Oise near Saint-Leu-d'Esserent. The river has relatively high turbidity and its brownish water has a modest velocity due to the slight gradient of the watercourse; pH levels have been measured at 9.25 or quite alkalineHogan, C. Michael, Water quality of freshwater bodies in France, Lumina Tech Press, Aberdeen (2006) near the Chateau d'Ermenonville and electrical conductivity of the waters have tested at 81 micro-siemens per centimetre. ==References== Category:Rivers of France Category:Rivers of Hauts- de-France Category:Rivers of Oise
