John Hoadly, 1733 engraving by John Faber the Younger after Isaac Whood. John Hoadly (27 September 1678 - 19 July 1746) was an Anglican divine in the Church of Ireland. He served as Bishop of Ferns and Leighlin (1727 to 1730), as Archbishop of Dublin (1730 to 1742), and as Archbishop of Armagh from 1742 until his death. ==Life== He was born at Tottenham, Middlesex, 27 September 1678, and was younger brother of Benjamin Hoadly. He was a member of St. Catharine's Hall, Cambridge (B.A. 1697), and in September 1700 was appointed under-master of Norwich grammar school, of which his father was head-master. After passing some years there he became chaplain to Bishop Gilbert Burnet, who gave him the rectory of St. Edmund's, Salisbury, and made him successively prebendary (21 February 1705-6), archdeacon (6 November 1710), and chancellor (16 April 1713) of Salisbury. The author of a pamphlet The Salisbury Quarrel Ended of 1710, relating to local conflicts, attributed to Hoadly's influence the High Church party's troubles with Burnet. He was also attacked for his friendship with Thomas Chubb. In 1717 Lord King, as chief justice of the common pleas, presented Hoadly to the rectory of Ockham, Surrey; and in 1727 he was consecrated bishop of Leighlin and Ferns. William Whiston protested because he thought Hoadly ignorant. In July 1729 a vacancy occurred in the archbishopric of Dublin, Hugh Boulter wrote to Sir Robert Walpole in support; and Hoadly was translated to Dublin in January 1730. As archbishop of Dublin he built the residence of Tallaght at a cost of PS2,500. In October 1742 Hoadly became archbishop of Armagh on Boulter's death, the lord-lieutenant, the Duke of Devonshire, who was at court when the news arrived, telling the king that he could not do without him. As primate he consented to the abolition of restrictions on Roman Catholic services. He was for many years a major force in Irish politics. Hoadly died at Rathfarnham, 19 July 1746, of a fever. ==Works== Hoadly's writings consisted of occasional sermons, a pastoral letter on the rebellion of 1745, a defence of Burnet's work on the articles against William Binckes, 1703, and a commentary on Bishop William Beveridge's writings.
