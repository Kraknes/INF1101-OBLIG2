Pingshu (), or shuoshu (Shuo Shu ), is an art of entertainment in China. It is also called pinghua (Ping Hua ) in South China. Travelers in Beijing will often find taxi drivers listening to it on the radio.De Guo Ji Zhe Tan  Bei Jing Ren De "Wen Xue Sheng Tai ".

Pingshu was extremely popular in the 1980s, when the Chinese people were able to afford radios, through which many of such radio drama programs were transmitted to every household. People, young and old, would stick to the radio when they had the time, listening to these storytellings, many of which originated from ancient Chinese history. In the countryside, farmers would take radios to their fields and listen to the stories while they were working. In cities, old men would sit in a comfortable bamboo chair enjoying the stories while sipping tea. Many stories such as General Yue Fei (Shuo Yue Quan Chuan ), the Romance of the Three Kingdoms (San Guo Yan Yi ), Cavalier with White Eyebrows (Bai Mei Da Xia ), and Sui Tang Yanyi (Sui Tang Yan Yi ) gained popularity among young and old and became major topics of conversation. Famous storytellers or Pingshu performers such as Shan Tianfang (Dan Tian Fang , 1934-2018), Yuan Kuocheng (Yuan Kuo Cheng , 1929-2015), Tian Lianyuan (Tian Lian Yuan , born 1941), and Liu Lanfang (Liu Lan Fang , born 1944) consequently became well-known. Pingshu performers often wear gowns and stand behind a table, with a folded fan and a gavel (serving as a prop to strike the table as a warning to the audience to be quiet or as a means of attracting attention in order to strengthen the effect of the performance, especially at the beginning or during intervals). They often add their own commentaries on the subjects and the characters in their storytelling. In this way, the audience, while watching their performances, is not only entertained, but also educated and enlightened. Pingshu is popular in North and most of Northeast China. The art of storytelling, with its broad mass appeal, has resulted in the growth of other art forms, nurturing talented artists. Many great writers, in consequence, continued from there to tread the path of literature. In order to attract the new generation of listeners, some non-traditional content was also adopted as Pingshu, like Harry Potter.Xiao Ju Chang Ping Shu Kai Jiang <<Ha Li *Bo Te >> .
