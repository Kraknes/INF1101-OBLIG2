Richard "Dick" Alexander Milliken (born 2 September 1950) is a former Ireland international rugby union player. He toured South Africa in 1974 with the British and Irish Lions and at the time played club rugby for Bangor. Unhappily the following year (1975) he broke his leg and ankle together playing rugby. Following the injury he never regained his full athletic capabilities and was unable to add to his 14 Irish Caps. Nevertheless, he continued to play rugby for his home town Bangor and captained the 2nd Team in the 1977/78 season (at least!). ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Irish rugby union players Category:British and Irish Lions rugby union players from Ireland Category:Ireland international rugby union players Category:People educated at Bangor Grammar School Category:Ulster Rugby players
