Bedford College of Higher Education was a higher education institution in Bedford, England, specializing in teacher training. ==History== Until 1976, three separate institutions offered tertiary education in Bedford: Bedford College of Physical Education in Lansdowne Road (Physical Education training), Bedford College of Education in Polhill Avenue (initial teacher training), and Mander College of Further Education in Cauldwell Street. In 1976 these combined to become Bedford College of Higher Education. In 1994 the higher education areas merged with the De Montfort University (based in Leicester) and the further education part became Bedford College, Bedford (but still awarding HNDs and Foundation degrees). The teacher-training colleges left De Montfort in 2006 and merged with the University of Luton which changed its name to University of Bedfordshire. The Lansdowne campus was sold off in 2007 and remaining higher education provision focussed on the Polhill site. The University of Bedfordshire is now the largest provider of secondary physical education teachers in the UK. ==See also== * De Montfort University * University of Luton * University of Bedfordshire * Hereford College of Education ==External links== *https://web.archive.org/web/20060109234817/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviews/reports/subjectlevel/q39_97_textonly.htm *https://web.archive.org/web/20080415051141/http://www.galaxy.bedfordshire.gov.uk/webingres/bedfordshire/vlib/0.digitised_resources/bedford_colleges_bedford_training.htm Category:Defunct universities and colleges in England Category:University of Bedfordshire Category:Teacher training colleges in the United Kingdom Category:Educational institutions established in 1976 Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 1994 Category:1976 establishments in England Category:Education in Bedford
