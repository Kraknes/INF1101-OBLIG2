Jack Nash (born Albert Nash; 18 September 1873 - 6 December 1956) was an English cricketer. He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace off-break bowler who played for Glamorgan. He was born in Blean and died in Battersea. Originally a member of Cardiff Cricket Club in 1900, he quickly became a regular for the side, taking 12 for 77 in 1903, with his combination of expert spin and medium-pace. Nash left Cardiff in 1911, moved to Lancashire, to play for Haslingden, and later to Cardiff to play for Uddingston, where he stayed until 1919. He made his first-class debut in Glamorgan's first County Championship match, against Sussex in May 1921. At 47 years and 271 days old he was the oldest man ever to make his Championship debut. Nevertheless he was Glamorgan's leading bowler in 1921, taking 90 wickets - more than twice as many as anyone else for the county that year - at an average of 17.34.Wisden 1957, p. 947. He played on in 1922, then retired. He became a first-class umpire in 1926, a position he held until 1930. Nash was a tailend batsman throughout his career, alongside team-mates such as one- time county cricketer Sam Lowe, who had over 50 Minor Counties appearances to his credit, and later in his career, the likes of Harry Creber. ==References== ==External links== *Jack Nash at Cricket Archive Category:1873 births Category:1956 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:Glamorgan cricketers Category:People from Blean
