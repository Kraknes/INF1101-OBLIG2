Hotonj is a settlement in Vogosca municipality, near Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. ==Population== ===Ethnic composition, 1991 census=== total: 3,064 * Muslims - 2,052 (66.97%) * Serbs - 807 (26.33%) * Yugoslavs - 92 (3.00%) * Croats - 54 (1.76%) * others and unknown - 59 (1.92%) ==History== During the 1992-1995 war, it was the front line between Serb forces and Bosnian Army, so it suffered destruction mainly from Light weapons. After the war it became integral part of Federation, so most of Serbs moved out, and housing has been bought by Bosniaks. Additionally, it has undergone intensive construction (Mosque, sport fields, oil pumps, renewed and widened asphalt roads, etc.) since about 2000, because of its very appealing position between Sarajevo and Vogosca. ==References== * Official results from the book: Ethnic composition of Bosnia-Herzegovina population, by municipalities and settlements, 1991. census, Zavod za statistiku Bosne i Hercegovine - Bilten no.234, Sarajevo 1991.
