In enzymology, an aminocarboxymuconate-semialdehyde decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :2-amino-3-(3-oxoprop-1-en-1-yl)but-2-enedioate \rightleftharpoons 2-aminomuconate semialdehyde + CO2 Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 2-amino-3-(3-oxoprop-1-en-1-yl)but-2-enedioate, and two products, 2-aminomuconate semialdehyde and CO2. This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. This enzyme participates in tryptophan metabolism. == Nomenclature == The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-amino-3-(3-oxoprop-1-en-1-yl)but-2-enedioate carboxy-lyase (2-aminomuconate- semialdehyde-forming). Other names in common use include picolinic acid carboxylase, picolinic acid decarboxylase, alpha-amino-beta-carboxymuconate- epsilon-semialdehade decarboxylase, alpha-amino-beta-carboxymuconate-epsilon- semialdehyde, beta-decarboxylase, 2-amino-3-(3-oxoprop-2-enyl)but-2-enedioate carboxy-lyase, and 2-amino-3-(3-oxoprop-1-en-1-yl)but-2-enedioate carboxy- lyase. == References == == Further reading == * Category:EC 4.1.1 Category:Enzymes of known structure
