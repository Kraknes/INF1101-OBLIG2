Led Zeppelin's Spring 1969 North American Tour was the second concert tour of North America by the English rock band. The tour commenced on 18 April and concluded on 31 May 1969. By this point in time, Led Zeppelin's popularity was such that the group had reached top billing, sharing that honour for some of their gigs with established acts such as Julie Driscoll, Delaney & Bonnie and Three Dog Night.Lewis, Dave and Pallett, Simon (1997) Led Zeppelin: The Concert File, London: Omnibus Press. , p. 24. They were now receiving four times the money that they had previously commanded on their first tour of America just a few months earlier.Chris Welch (1994) Led Zeppelin, London: Orion Books. , p. 39. Also, the band for some of its performances was one of the first groups to give single bill concerts without an opening act.Luis Rey (1997) Led Zeppelin Live: An Illustrated Exploration of Underground Tapes, Ontario: The Hot Wacks Press, p. 38. However, for the band's concert at Columbia, Maryland, on 25 May, manager Peter Grant agreed for Led Zeppelin to receive second billing in support of The Who. This was the only time that these two English bands ever performed on the same bill.Led Zeppelin official website: concert summary During this tour the band took time out to record tracks at various recording studios for their forthcoming album, Led Zeppelin II. Many of the tracks were later mixed down by Eddie Kramer at A&R; Studios, New York City.Led Zeppelin Discography It was during this period that Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page switched from using his Telecaster to his signature Gibson Les Paul, whilst also incorporating the use of Marshall amplifiers. ==Tour set list== The fairly typical set list for the tour was: #"Train Kept A-Rollin' " (Bradshaw, Kay, Mann) #"I Can't Quit You Baby" (Dixon) #"Dazed and Confused" (Page) #"As Long As I Have You" (Mimms) (dropped after 24 May) #"Killing Floor" (Wolf) #"White Summer"/"Black Mountain Side" (Page) #"Sitting And Thinking" (Guy) (on 27 April only) #"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You" (Bredon, Page, Plant) #"You Shook Me" (Dixon, Lenoir) #"How Many More Times" (Bonham, Jones, Page) #"Communication Breakdown" (Bonham, Jones, Page) #"Pat's Delight" (Bonham) #"Whole Lotta Love" (Bonham, Dixon, Jones, Page, Plant) (on 26 April, 11 May, and 25 May only) There were some set list substitutions, variations, and order switches during the tour. ==Tour dates== {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;" ! style="width:150px;"| Date ! style="width:200px;"| City ! style="width:140px;"| Country ! style="width:220px;"| Venue |- |24 April 1969 | rowspan="4"|San Francisco | rowspan="12" |United States | Fillmore West |- |25 April 1969 | rowspan="2"|Winterland Ballroom |- |26 April 1969 |- |27 April 1969 | Fillmore West |- |29 April 1969 | rowspan="2" |Los Angeles | rowspan="2" |Whiskey A Go Go |- |30 April 1969 |- |1 May 1969 | Irvine | Crawford Hall - UC Irvine |- |2 May 1969 | rowspan="2"|Pasadena | rowspan="2"|Rose Palace |- |3 May 1969 |- |4 May 1969 | rowspan="2"|Santa Monica | rowspan="2"|Santa Monica Civic Center |- |5 May 1969 |- |7 May 1969 |Portland |Portland Memorial Coliseum |- |9 May 1969 | Edmonton | rowspan="2"|Canada | Edmonton Gardens |- |10 May 1969 | Vancouver | PNE Agrodome |- |11 May 1969 | Seattle | rowspan="16" |United States | Green Lake Aqua Theater |- |13 May 1969 | Honolulu | Civic Auditorium |- |16 May 1969 | Detroit | Grande Ballroom two shows |- |17 May 1969 | Athens, OH | Convocation Center |- |18 May 1969 | Minneapolis | Guthrie Theater |- |21 May 1969 |Syracuse |Onondaga County Auditorium |- |23 May 1969 | rowspan="2" | Chicago | rowspan="2" | Kinetic Playground |- |24 May 1969 |- |25 May 1969 | Columbia, MD | Merriweather Post Pavilion |- | ~~26 May 1969~~ | rowspan="4" |Boston | rowspan="4" |Boston Tea Party |- |27 May 1969 |- |28 May 1969 |- |29 May 1969 |- |30 May 1969 | rowspan="2"|New York City | rowspan="2"|Fillmore East |- |31 May 1969 |- | ~~1 June 1969~~ | ~~St. Louis~~ | ~~Kiel Auditorium~~ |} ==References== ==External links== *Comprehensive archive of known concert appearances by Led Zeppelin (official website) *Led Zeppelin concert setlists ==Sources== *Lewis, Dave and Pallett, Simon (1997) Led Zeppelin: The Concert File, London: Omnibus Press. .
