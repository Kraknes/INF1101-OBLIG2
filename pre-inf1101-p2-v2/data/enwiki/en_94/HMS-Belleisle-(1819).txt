{| |} Plans of Belleisle HMS Belleisle was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched on 26 April 1819 at Pembroke Dockyard. Belleisle was converted to serve as a troopship in 1841. On 10 June 1856, she ran aground on the Englishman's Shoal, in the Bosphorus. She was refloated on 13 June. Belleisle was subsequently used as a hospital ship at Chatham. In June 1866, she was lent by the Admiralty to the Seamen's Hospital Society for use as a hospitaly ship in London for seamen suffering from cholera. Whilst being towed up the River Thames by the tug Medusa, she ran aground, but was refloated on the next tide. Belleisle was broken up in 1872. ==Notes== ==References== *Lavery, Brian (2003) The Ship of the Line - Volume 1: The development of the battlefleet 1650-1850.
