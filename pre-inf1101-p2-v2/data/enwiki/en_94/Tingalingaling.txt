"'Tingalingaling" (also credited as Tingeling) is the thirteenth single by Dutch girl group Luv', released in the summer of 1981 by CNR/Carrere Records. The song appears on the album Forever Yours and the compilation Goodbye Luv. It was meant to be Luv's farewell to its public. Although the female pop act didn't know at this time, they would make several reunions in the future. ==Song history== "My Number One" succeeded in being a smash hit in Benelux, proving that Luv's new member Ria Thielsch was accepted by the public. However, a couple of months after the record's release, Marga Scheide, the blonde singer of the group, became overworked because Luv' toured Europe extensively. That's why, in early 1981 they stopped their concerts but continued the TV and radio performances. Luv's end was near. In March, an official statement announced Luv's break-up. A Dutch DJ, Hugo van Gelderen, often played on the TROS radio station "Tingalingaling", an uptempo post disco and synth pop track taken from the last studio album Forever Yours. The song was so popular among the TROS listeners and Luv's fans that Carrere Records decided to release it as a single. The group made a farewell performance later, in July, on the Nederland Muziekland show on Veronica (TV channel) in Spakenburg to promote what was supposed to be their last single. Then, a compilation Goodbye Luv', including the repertoire from 1979 to 1981, came out. ==Chart performance== Because of a lack of promotion as Luv' disbanded, "Tingalingaling" was a moderate hit in the Netherlands. {| class="wikitable" !Charts (1980) !Peak position |- |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Lyrics to Tingalingaling Category:1980 songs Category:1981 singles Category:Luv' songs Category:Songs written by Hans van Hemert Category:Songs written by Piet Souer Category:Carrere Records singles
