Gzira United Football Club is a Maltese football club from the small harbor town of Gzira in central Malta, which currently plays in the Maltese Premier League. ==History== The club was founded in 1947, won the FA Trophy in 1973 and First Division league Champions. Often plays in Maroon with light blue sleeves on the shirt, with white shorts and white socks. Following the club's promotion to the Maltese Premier League, they signed a sponsorship agreement with JEEP, the global SUV brand, with the agreement of organizing events for the local community. Season 2016/17 the Club played in BOV Premier League for the first time ever and finished 7th place. In the following year 2017/18 the maroons placed 3rd place and participated for the first time in the Uefa Europa League. Season 2018/19 was another successful one where again Gzira placed 3rd place and assured their selves to play again in the Europa League for another time. ===The Hajduk miracle=== On 18 July 2019, Gzira were facing the big Croatian club Hajduk Split at Split for the second leg of the first qualifying round of the 2019-20 UEFA Europa League. Gzira had lost the first leg match at home 0-2, a result which was considered normal, due to the big budget differences between the two clubs. The match in Split had the Croatians as strong favorites, offering odds of 1/15 (1.07 in decimal odds) for Hajduk to win the match. Hajduk went at half time winning 1-0. However, Brazilian forward Jefferson equalized for Gzira at the 57th minute, and Hamed Kone scored at the 69th minute making the score 1-2 for Gzira. This result was still not enough for the Maltese side, but found a final goal in the sixth and last minute of injury time, again with Hamed Kone, making the score 1-3 for Gzira, with the Maltese side advancing on away goals rule. This result was considered a major shock for the Croatians, with their manager Sinisa Orescanin being sacked shortly after. ==Players== ===Current squad=== ===Former players=== * Caio Garcia ==Executive Board== Chairman Sharlon Pace Vice Chairman Roberto Cristiano Chief Executive Officer Edward Zammit Tabona General Secretary Dr Ian Micallef Chief Financial Officer Alexander Cassar == Personnel == === Technical staff === {| class="wikitable" |- !Position !Staff |- |Coach | Darren Abdilla |- |Team Manager | Marlon Galea |- | Assistant Coach | Andrew Cohen |- |Goalkeeper Trainer | Domenic Ellul |- |Physical trainer | Antonio Romagnolo |- |Doctor | Dr.Michele Pellitteri |- |Physiotherapist | Cedric Sciberras |- |Physiotherapist | Karl Azzopardi |- |Kit manager | Jason Micallef |- |Kit manager | Anthony Busuttil |} == Major Honours == Maltese FA Trophy 1 1972-73 ==European record== {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left" |- !
