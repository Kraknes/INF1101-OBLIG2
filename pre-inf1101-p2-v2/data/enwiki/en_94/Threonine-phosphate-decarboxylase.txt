In enzymology, a threonine-phosphate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :L-threonine O-3-phosphate \rightleftharpoons (R)-1-aminopropan-2-yl phosphate + CO2 Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-threonine O-3-phosphate, and two products, (R)-1-aminopropan-2-yl phosphate and CO2. This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-threonine-O-3-phosphate carboxy-lyase [(R)-1-aminopropan-2-yl-phosphate-forming]. Other names in common use include L-threonine-O-3-phosphate decarboxylase, CobD and L-threonine-O-3-phosphate carboxy-lyase. This enzyme is part of the biosynthetic pathway to cobalamin (vitamin B12) in anaerobic bacteria such as Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus megaterium. In the next step, (R)-1-aminopropan-2-ol is attached to adenosylcobyric acid, forming adenosylcobinamide phosphate. ==See also== * Cobalamin biosynthesis ==References== * * * * Category:EC 4.1.1 Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
