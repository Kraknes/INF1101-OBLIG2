{| |} HMNZS Wakakura (T00) was originally a First World War naval trawler built in Canada. Ordered by the Admiralty, the vessel, named TR 1, was loaned to the Royal Canadian Navy for use on the East Coast of Canada. She was purchased by New Zealand in 1926 and transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy when it was established in 1941. Wakakura remained in commission throughout the Second World War and was sold to Tasman Steamship Co and converted to a refrigerated cargo vessel in 1947. > "A little trawler paid a big part in the lives of New Zealand's pre-war and > wartime naval reservists.
