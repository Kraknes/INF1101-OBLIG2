Stephen of Durazzo (born Stefano di Durazzo, later known as Estevao de Napoles in Portugal) (c.1320-1380) was an Italian nobleman and warrior, the claimed youngest son of John, Duke of Durazzo, ruler of the Kingdom of Albania, by his wife Agnes de Perigord and a grandson of king Charles II of Naples. But this is a posterior fabrication, as the origin of the surname de Napoles, for there is no notice of any such legitimate or bastard son of a Prince of Naples. He moved to Portugal as a crusader, having fought the Moors alongside "his cousin" king Afonso IV of Portugal at the battle of Salado, as mentioned in Duarte Nunes de Leao's Chronicles of the Kings of Portugal. Known in Portugal as Estevao de Napoles (Stephen of Naples), he gave origin to the Portuguese family Napoles, a false branch of the royal Capetian House of Anjou-Naples. == Marriage and children == Stephen of Durazzo is known to have married in Portugal, but his wife's name is not known. His only (known) son was Leonardo Estevao de Napoles, although an unnamed daughter is sometimes referred. == See also == *Napoles *Duchy of Durazzo (Angevin) *Capetian House of Anjou ==References== *Pereira Marques, Antonio Augusto.
