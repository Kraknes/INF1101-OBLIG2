In enzymology, an acetylene hydratase () is a rare example of an enzyme containing tungsten. It catalyzes the hydration of acetylene to give acetaldehyde: :C2H2 \+ H2O - CH3CHO The W centre is bound to two molybdopterin cofactors. The mechanism is thought to involve attachment of acetylene to the metal followed by nucleophilic attack of water. This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetaldehyde hydro-lyase (acetylene-forming). Other names in common use include AH, and acetaldehyde hydro-lyase. Acetylene hydratase participates in tetrachloroethene degradation. ==References== Category:EC 4.2.1
