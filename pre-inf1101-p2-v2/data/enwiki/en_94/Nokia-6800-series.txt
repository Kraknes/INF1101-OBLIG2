The Nokia 6800 series are a selection of Nokia Series 68 phones with an unusual fold-out QWERTY keyboard. This type of keyboard is also used in the more recent Nokia Series 60 Symbian-based Nokia E70. These phones were marketed as "messaging devices": all had built-in email clients, and some had BlackBerry support. The 6800 and 6810 had four electrical contacts at the very top of the phone for the left side of the keyboard and another four just under the screen for when the regular 12-key numeric keypad was being used. A small magnet was built into the left side of the keyboard and the phones would switch to landscape mode as soon as this was lifted up. The 6820 and 6822 had the wiring for the keypad built into the hinges without any external contacts. The 6800 series was superseded in May 2006 by the Nokia E70. This was essentially the business version of the 6800 devices, with significantly upgraded connectivity options, build and screen. ==Nokia 6800== The 6800 was the first in the series and was a dual-band GSM 900/1800 phone with support for GPRS.Nokia 6800 - Full phone specifications The 6800 had an FM radio tuner and 5MB of memory.
