Davies in their 2006 work The Myth of the Eastern Front as one of the leading publishers of war romancing literature, second in North America only to the Canadian publisher J.J. Fedorowicz.

Schiffer has a strong focus on the German side of the conflict, with 204 titles in its 1996 military history catalogue being dedicated to the German war effort, out of a total of 234 titles. The catalogue described one of Schiffer's titles as the story of "the great aces" who "could not win, yet they fought to the final hour in an unforgettable combat saga". ==Imprints== Besides Schiffer Publishing, the principal imprints were: * Schiffer Military History: military history, aviation, transportation, modeling, militaria, and related collectibles * Whitford Press: paranormal activities and mind and spirit lifestyles * Cornell Maritime Press: for personnel in marine businesses: texts for the Merchant Marine Academies, boating, water safety, maritime law, salvage, navigation, and regional maritime history * Tidewater Publishers: life and history in the Chesapeake Bay region for children and adults *Schiffer Fashion Press ==References== ===General references=== * ===Inline citations=== ==External links== * Category:Publishing companies of the United States Category:Book publishing companies based in Pennsylvania
