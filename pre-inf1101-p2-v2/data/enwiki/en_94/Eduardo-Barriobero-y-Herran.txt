During the Spanish Civil War he became the presiding judge of the anarchists' "People's Tribunal" in Barcelona. He soon ran afoul of the Republican government, who accused him of embezzling some of the fines he collected.Judge's Trial, Time Magazine, Monday, Feb. 20, 1939 He was captured by the Francoists in 1939, and in his subsequent trial he denied being an anarchist, saying "I am not an anarchist. I am a radical anticlerical Freemason."
