Patty & the Emblems were an American pop group from Camden, New Jersey. The group was a one-hit wonder, scoring their only Top 40 hit in the U.S. and Canada with "Mixed Up, Shook Up Girl" in 1964.[ Billboard], Allmusic.com Their follow-up was "I'm Confused." The group continued recording singles until 1967, but never reached the same kind of success. Every member, except Patty Russell who left the industry, continued to have long-enduring music careers.http://www.dvrbs.com/people/CamdenShowbiz-Patty&theEmblems.htm; ==Chart history for "Mixed Up, Shook Up Girl"== {| class="wikitable sortable" |- !Chart (1964) !Peak position |- |Canada RPM Top Singles | style="text-align:center;"|24 |- |US Billboard Hot 100Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1990 - | style="text- align:center;"|37 |- |US Cash Box Top 100 |align="center"|28 |- |} ==Members== *Patty Russell (died September 5, 1998)Joel Whitburn, The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits. 7th edn, 2000 *Eddie Watts Sr. *Vance Walker (died February 1, 2008) *Alexander Wildes (died November 13, 1998) ==References== Category:Musical groups from New Jersey
