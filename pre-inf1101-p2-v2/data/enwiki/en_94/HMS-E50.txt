{| |} HMS E50 was a British E class submarine built by John Brown, Clydebank. She was launched on 13 November 1916 and was commissioned on 23 January 1917. E50 was damaged in a collision with the Imperial German Navy submarine UC-62 while submerged in the North Sea off the North Hinder Light Vessel on 19 March 1917. E 50 was lost on 1 February 1918, and it was earlier believed that she struck a mine in the North Sea off the South Dogger Light Vessel. In 2011 the wreck was found by a Danish Expedition much closer to the Danish coast, 65 NM west of Nymindegab.Sea War Museum Jutland ==Design== Like all post-E8 British E-class submarines, E50 had a displacement of at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of and a beam length of . She was powered by two Vickers eight-cylinder two-stroke diesel engines and two electric motors.Akerman, P. (1989). Encyclopaedia of British submarines 1901-1955\. 149-150\. Maritime Books. The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of . British E-class submarines had fuel capacities of of diesel and ranges of when travelling at . E50 was capable of operating submerged for five hours when travelling at . E50 was armed with a 12-pounder QF gun mounted forward of the conning tower. She had five 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, two in the bow, one either side amidships, and one in the stern; a total of 10 torpedoes were carried. E-Class submarines had wireless systems with power ratings; in some submarines, these were later upgraded to systems by removing a midship torpedo tube. Their maximum design depth was although in service some reached depths of below . Some submarines contained Fessenden oscillator systems. ==Salvage and commemoration== The conning tower from E 50 was in a very bad state, when it was rediscovered by a Danish expedition in 2011.The tower was already torn off the hull and was laying isolated on the seabed, seriously damaged by heavy fishing gear. The Danish team decided to raise the remnants in order to prevent complete destruction, and could do so in compliance with international law.The commemoration plaque with the names of the men, who perished with HM E 50 The conning tower from HM E 50 with the damage from fishing gear clearly visible Afterwards the tower went through a very comprehensive restoration, and since 2015 it has been on display at Sea War Museum Jutland in Thyboron, where also the 31 men, who lost their life in the submarine, are commemorated on a plaque in front of the tower.Sea War Museum Jutland ==References== ==Bibliography== * * Category:British E-class submarines of the Royal Navy Category:Ships built on the River Clyde Category:1916 ships Category:World War I submarines of the United Kingdom Category:Maritime incidents in 1917 Category:Maritime incidents in 1918 Category:Ships sunk by mines Category:World War I shipwrecks in the North Sea Category:Royal Navy ship names
