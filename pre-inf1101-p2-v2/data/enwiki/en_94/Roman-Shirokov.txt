Roman Nikolayevich Shirokov ( ; born 6 July 1981) is an assailant, Russian international football official and a former player. As a player, he was described as "a deep-lying midfielder with an aptitude for getting forward to score goals". ==Club career== ===Early career=== Before signing for Zenit, Shirokov played for FC Khimki, Rubin Kazan, Saturn Moscow Oblast, FC Vidnoye, FC Istra, Torpedo-ZIL Moscow and CSKA Moscow's farm club. ===Zenit=== Shirokov started his first season for Zenit as central back, as then-head coach Dick Advocaat was forced to fill the gaps left in the centre of defence after the departure of Martin Skrtel to Liverpool and severe injury to Nicolas Lombaerts. He adapted to the new position fairly well and featured as a centre-back in the 2008 UEFA Cup Final victory over Rangers, pairing with Ivica Krizanac. In 2009, he was moved back to midfield. On 30 June 2014, Shirokov announced that after almost 200 games in six-years for Zenit, that he wouldn't be signing a new contract and will continue his career at another club. ===Spartak Moscow=== On 18 July 2014 it was announced that Shirokov signed a contract with Spartak Moscow as a free agent. After a long recovery from an injury he made his debut for Spartak on 26 October 2014 in a game against FC Lokomotiv Moscow, scoring a late equalizer in a 1-1 game. On 13 January 2015, he was loaned back to FC Krasnodar. Despite being one of the most important players of the team, Shirokov was benched during the 2015-16 season, in order to not pay him the amount due to him by contract if he plays a certain number of minutes.http://www.sports.ru/tribuna/blogs/dud/866726.html The President of the RFU, Vitaly Mutko, commented: "He's one of the best footballers in our country. I don't understand why he's not playing. If it's due to the contract clause that's just dishonest."http://www.sports.ru/football/1035151089.html On 23 January 2016, his Spartak contract was dissolved by mutual consent. ===CSKA Moscow=== On 9 February 2016, he returned to his first club, PFC CSKA Moscow, signing a contract until the end of the 2015-16 season with an extension option. His contract was not extended at the end of the season. ==International career== Shirokov preparing for a friendly against Bulgaria in August 2010 Shirokov made his debut in the Russia national football team on 28 March 2008 during a friendly match in Romania. He was called up for the Euro 2008 and started in the opening group match against Spain, being deployed in the centre of defence as then-manager of Russia Guus Hiddink decided to follow the footsteps of his compatriot Advocaat, thus relegating experienced Sergey Ignashevich to the bench.
