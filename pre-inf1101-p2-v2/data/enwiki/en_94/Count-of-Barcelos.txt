The Coat of Arms of the Meneses family, the first to bear the title of Count of Barcelos. The Coat of Arms of Afonso, 8th Count of Barcelos in 1401, when he inherited it from his father-in-law, Nuno Alvares Pereira. Count of Barcelos (in Portuguese Conde de Barcelos) is a title of nobility, the first to be granted in Portugal. It was created in 1298 by king Denis I and initially it was a non hereditary title, although most of the holders belonged to the Teles de Menezes family. It was only after the death of the 6th Count, when it was granted to Nuno Alvares Pereira, that the title became hereditary. The 8th Count of Barcelos was created Duke of Braganza in 1442, by his nephew king Afonso V, and his descendants rose to the Portuguese throne after the country regained its independence from Spain in 1640. Initially, the seat of the Counts of Barcelos was the Castle of Barcelos, a large medieval structure that overlooks the Cavado river. After having been granted the Dukedom of Braganza, the family moved to a larger and more urbane palace in Guimaraes. The title is currently held by Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza and 31st Count of Barcelos, claimant to the throne of Portugal. ==List of the Counts of Barcelos== ===Non-hereditary title (1298)=== *1.
