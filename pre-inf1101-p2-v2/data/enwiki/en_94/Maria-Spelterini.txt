Niagara gorge on a tightrope Maria Spelterini (sometimes spelled Spelterina and occasionally referred to as Marie, July 7, 1853 - October 19, 1912) was an Italian tightrope walker who was the only woman to cross the Niagara gorge on a tightrope, which she did on July 8, 1876 as part of a celebration of the U.S. Centennial. She used two and a quarter inch (57 mm) wire and crossed just north of the lower suspension bridge. She crossed again on July 12, 1876, this time wearing peach baskets strapped to her feet. She crossed blindfolded on July 19, and on July 22 she crossed with her ankles and wrists manacled. She had previously toured Europe, performing at Moscow (crossing the Moskva River), St. Petersburg (crossing the River Neva), Saint Aubin on the Island of Jersey (August, 1872), and Catalan (24 August 1873). In a May 5, 1877 performance in Rosario, Argentina she survived a fall while riding a velocipede (bicycle) that malfunctioned on a wire. An article appeared in the French newspaper L'Univers illustre in October, 1873, showing her crossing the harbour at Saint Aubin, Jersey and her portrait. Italian rock noir band Belladonna dedicated to Maria Spelterini their song Maria Spelterini in their 2016 album The Orchestral Album. ==References== ==External links== * Images of Maria Spelterini tightrope walking over Niagara Falls Niagara Falls Public Library (Ont.) * Niagara's first female rope walker dazzled thousands with her stunts * Life of lady wire walker shrouded in mystery / Spelterini, Maria * Spanish article on the Argentina performance * Maria Spelterini first woman to cross the Niagara Falls * Stunters and Daredevils * A History of Stunting at Niagara Category:1853 births Category:1912 deaths Category:Italian entertainers Category:Tightrope walkers Category:Women stunt performers Category:19th-century circus performers
