WUJX-LD, virtual and UHF digital channel 18, is a low-powered Spanish independent television station licensed to Jacksonville, Florida, United States. The station is owned by Budd Broadcasting. WUJX-LD's transmitter is located on Hogan Road in Jacksonville's Killarney Shores section. ==History== The station originally launched on digital as WJXE-LP on December 1, 2007 and began branding as "Fresh TV". The station entered an agreement with Comcast to make the station available to all of its 300,000 subscribers in the Jacksonville area. It was to be offered on Comcast channel 14. The station claimed that its local programming was intended to be targeted towards African Americans. Plans for the channel were aborted, and the station never signed on. The station changed its call sign to WVVQ-LD on June 29, 2009. The station changed its call sign to the current WUJX-LD on November 10, 2015 and became a Univision affiliate. In the summer of 2018, an entity known as Punch TV leased the station to carry its programming, and the station ended its Univision affiliation. As of late 2018, WUJX became a Spanish independent station, and added several subchannels of shopping and paid programming, ending the lease from Punch TV. ==Other Budd Broadcasting Stations== *WGVT-LD - Gainesville, Florida *WNFT-LD - Gainesville, Florida *WOFT-LD - Orlando, Florida *WUJX-LD - Jacksonville, Florida ==Former Budd Broadcasting Stations== *WFXU - Live Oak, Florida - sold to Gray Television *WGFL - High Springs, Florida - sold to Pegasus Communications *WKUG-LP - Glasgow, Kentucky - defunct *WKUT-LD - Elizabethtown, Kentucky - sold to HC2 Holdings *WKUW-LD - White House, Tennessee - sold to HC2 Holdings ==References== ==External links== * * UJX-LD UJX-LD Category:Univision network affiliates Category:Television channels and stations established in 1997 Category:1997 establishments in Florida
