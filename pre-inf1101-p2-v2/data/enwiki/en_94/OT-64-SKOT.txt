The OT-64 SKOT (Czech acronym for: Stredni Kolovy Obrneny Transporter, and/or Polish Sredni Kolowy Opancerzony Transporter - medium wheeled armoured transporter) is an amphibious, armored personnel carrier (8x8), developed jointly by Poland (PRL) and Czechoslovakia (CSSR) well into the 1960s. Until the early 1970s Czechoslovakia and Poland produced around 4,500 OT-64 SKOTs of all variants, just under a third of which were exported.BURIAN, Michal; DITE, Josef; DUBANEK, Martin.

Stefanowska (red.), J. Magnuski, Seria: Typy broni i uzbrojenia, vol. 9, Warszawa: Wydawnictwo Ministerstwa Obrony Narodowej, 1971. In 2002, the modernization of the SKOT transporter began in Poland. The work resulted in the KTO Rys prepared by Wojskowe Zaklady Mechaniczne No. 5 from Poznan. ==History== OT-64 was intended to replace the halftrack OT-810, which was nearly identical to the German Sd.Kfz. 251 from World War II. The first prototype was built in 1959. In 1961 the first sample series were built and starting from October 1963 the vehicles were produced in Lublin, Poland by Fabryka Samochodow Ciezarowych. Serial production of the transporter started at FSC in Lublin (Poland) on October 12, 1963. The Polish plant acted as an assembly plant. Components of the propulsion system and power transmission (engine Tatra, transmission Praga and chassis) were imported from Czechoslovakia. Armored hulls and towers (Huta in Ostrowiec Swietokrzyski and Huta Czestochowa), elements of the suspension system (Huta Stalowa Wola) and on-board armaments (Zaklady Mechaniczne in Tarnow) were manufactured in Poland. Production ended on July 22, 1971. Of the 4,500 OT-64s produced, 2,500 of them were obtained by the Polish army, and 2,000 of them by the Czechoslovak armyBURIAN, Michal; DITE, Josef; DUBANEK, Martin.

Later, after introducing the BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles into service, SKOT transporters were exported to other countries. Today they are gradually being replaced by newer vehicles. ==Technology== OT-64 SKOT in an amphibious assault exercise SKOT-2AP The OT-64's engine, transmission, suspension and axles were produced in Czechoslovakia. The engine was produced by Tatra. The gearbox was manufactured by Praga Hostivar. It has a pre-select Praga-Wilson gearbox, (5 forward +1 reverse gears.) A gear is selected using the gear stick then when the gear is required the left pedal (gear change action/clutch combined) is pressed to the floor, giving a hiss of air sound, on release of the pedal the dry plate clutch engages after about half the return spring controlled movement. The drive then passes to an auxiliary gearbox with low, neutral and high ratios which needs to be selected before moving off, for road/neutral/off-road use, this gives option to the driver of 10 forward and 2 reverse ratios. The gear change pedal is hydraulic and on action opens an air valve which causes the selected gear to engage. The armored hull and weapons were produced in Poland. The OT-64 was the answer to the Soviet BTR-60. Contrary to this, the OT-64 used a diesel set in place of a petrol engine. That diminished the danger of fire and at the same time increased the range. The main advantage in relation to the Russian counterpart was the full-armored interior. The entrance is at the rear of the vehicle via twin doors. The OT-64 had an NBC protection facility and night-vision equipment. It also has central inflation for all wheels which can be controlled by driver during a drive. The OT-64 was air-transportable and amphibious, for the transport on water used two propellers installed at the back. Several variants were built. Some OT-64 were re-equipped for air defense or built as tank hunters. The latter used the AT-3 Sagger missile as a weapon. ==Service history== OT-64 SKOT entered service with Polish and Czechoslovak armies in 1963. It was produced until the early 1970s. It is still in service in Poland and Slovakia, among other operated by the Slovak police. Czech units were replaced in 2006 by new armoured vehicles Pandur II CZ. During the 1990s, Slovakia purchased hundreds of these units from the Czech Republic (150 in 1994, 100 in 1998). Slovaks then sold them to other, mainly African, countries. OT-64 SKOT was also exported to eleven different countries. A total number of vehicles produced is 4,500. ==Variants== ===Czechoslovakia=== SKOT-1A during reconstruction of Martial law in Poland.
