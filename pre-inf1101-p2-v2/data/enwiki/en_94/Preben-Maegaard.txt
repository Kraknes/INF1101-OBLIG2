Preben Maegaard (born September 25, 1935), is a Danish renewable energy pioneer, author and expert. Since the oil crisis in 1974 he has worked for the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Preben Maegaard is co- founder of the Nordic Folkecenter for Renewable Energy, established in 1983, and its director 1984 till 2013 (www.folkecenter.net). == Work == Preben Maegaard works locally, nationally and internationally at the organisational, political and technological levels within broad spectrum of renewable energy technologies. From 1979 to 1984 Preben Maegaard was chairman of the Danish Renewable Energy Association (OVE),Danish Renewable Energy Association (OVE) since 1991, vice-president of Eurosolar (the European Renewable Energy Association) and in 2006, appointed senior vice-president.EUROSOLAR Since 1992 he has been co-ordinator of the European Solar Prize in Denmark and member of the European Solar Prize Jury. In 1995 he became Member of Senate, UTER, Technical University, Havana. In 1996 and the following years, Preben Maegaard was member of the board of EUROSUN, an intergroup set up by the European Parliament. Since 1999, he has been a board member of the European Renewable Energies Federation (EREF) European Renewable Energies Federation (EREF) and Renewable Energy Adviser to the President of Mali, Alpha Konare, leading to the establishment of the Mali Folkecenter.Mali Folkecenter In 2001, he became a chairperson of the Committee of the World Council for Renewable Energy (WCRE).World Council for Renewable Energy (WCRE) When the World Wind Energy Association (WWEA) was founded in 2001, he became its first president, a position he held till 2005.World Wind Energy Association (WWEA) In May 2006, the World Wind Energy Institute (WWEI) World Wind Energy Institute (WWEI) was initiated in Kingston, Canada, involving seven institutes from China, Brazil, Cuba, Canada, Russia, Egypt and Denmark. Preben Maegaard was appointed the first president of the WWEI. He was co-founder of the SolarSuperState Association SolarSuperState Association when it was founded in 2012 and became its first president. As the director of the Folkecenter he has been responsible for the technological innovation of windmills, including design, construction and implementation of sizes from 20 to 525 kW, farm biogas digesters from 50 to 1000 m3 as well as integrated energy systems including hydrogen and biofuels for transport. The technological development and implementation activities took place in cooperation with DS Trade and Industry (www.ds-net.dk). The Folkecenter has under his leadership provided transfer of renewable energy technology to many countries, and set up numerous pilot projects worldwide. In 2002, the liberal government suspended the national renewable energy development and implementation activities and programs in which Preben Maegaard held positions. Danish State support to the Folkecenter received since 1983 was suspended as well. Since 2005, Folkecenter has received funding from the Energifonden and since 2012 support from the Danish state. Preben Maegaard has served on several Danish national governmental committees and councils for the development and implementation of renewable energy as member of: * Renewable Energy Steering Group (1981-1991); * National Board of Technology; National Renewable Energy Council in Denmark (1991-1996); * National Committee Biomass for Energy (1985-1989); * National Committee for Solar Energy (1995-2002); * National Committee for Wave Power (1997-2002); * National Committee for Hydrogen from Renewable for Transport Purposes (1998-2002). For over three decades, Preben Maegaard has been conference director, organiser, speaker and/or participant of numerous national and international seminars, workshops and conferences, chairman of the World Wind Energy Conferences: WWEC2003 in Cape Town, WWEC2004 in Beijing and WWEC2005 in Melbourne (www.wwindea.org). Preben Maegaard is author and/or co-author of numerous reports, books, articles and periodicals in Danish, English, German and Japanese within the field of renewable energy and sustainable development and has received a number of awards. In March 2010 Preben Maegaard was featured in documentary film The Fourth Revolution: Energy. ==Professional career== Education * 1957 - 1962: Economist, graduated in Microeconomics, Human Resources and International Trade.
