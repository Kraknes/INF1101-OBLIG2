In solid mechanics, it is common to analyze the properties of beams with constant cross section. Saint-Venant's theorem states that the simply connected cross section with maximal torsional rigidity is a circle.E. Makai, A proof of Saint-Venant's theorem on torsional rigidity, Acta Mathematica Hungarica, Volume 17, Numbers 3-4 / September, 419-422,1966 It is named after the French mathematician Adhemar Jean Claude Barre de Saint-Venant. Given a simply connected domain D in the plane with area A, \rho the radius and \sigma the area of its greatest inscribed circle, the torsional rigidity P of D is defined by : P= 4\sup_f \frac{\left( \iint\limits_D f\, dx\, dy\right)^2}{\iint\limits_D {f_x}^2+{f_y}^2\, dx\, dy}. Here the supremum is taken over all the continuously differentiable functions vanishing on the boundary of D. The existence of this supremum is a consequence of Poincare inequality. Saint-VenantA J-C Barre de Saint-Venant,popularly known as sNt vnNt Memoire sur la torsion des prismes, Memoires presentes par divers savants a l'Academie des Sciences, 14 (1856), pp. 233-560. conjectured in 1856 that of all domains D of equal area A the circular one has the greatest torsional rigidity, that is : P \le P_{\text{circle}} \le \frac{A^2}{2 \pi}. A rigorous proof of this inequality was not given until 1948 by Polya.G. Polya, Torsional rigidity, principal frequency, electrostatic capacity and symmetrization, Quarterly of Applied Math., 6 (1948), pp. 267, 277. Another proof was given by Davenport and reported in.G. Polya and G. Szego, Isoperimetric inequalities in Mathematical Physics (Princeton Univ.Press, 1951). A more general proof and an estimate :P< 4 \rho^2 A is given by Makai. ==Notes== Category:Elasticity (physics) Category:Calculus of variations Category:Inequalities Category:Physics theorems
