Grant can be both a surname and a given name. The name is of English, Scottish or Irish origin, and there are several possible origins for the name. *One possible origin of the name is from a nickname derived from the Anglo-Norman graund, graunt ("tall", "large"). This in turn was derived from the Old French grand, grant, which was originally derived from the Latin grandis. This nickname was likely given to a person of remarkable size or merely to distinguish two persons bearing the same name. *Another possible origin of the surname is from a medieval personal name ultimately derived from the Old English byname Granta, which might have meant "snarler".Grantham Name Meaning and Origin Retrieved on 2007-12-06 *The surname is also associated with the surname MacGranny in Ireland.Grant Surname Map of Ireland Retrieved on 2019-12-27 *The surname may also be an alternate spelling of the German Grandt or Grand.Grant Name Meaning and Origin Retrieved on 2007-12-06 == Surname == === A-B-C === * Aaron Grant (1908-1966), American football player * Abbi Grant (born 1995), Scottish footballer * Alan Grant (disambiguation), several people * Sir Alexander Grant, 10th Baronet (1826-1884), Principal of the University of Edinburgh * Alexander Grant (Upper Canada politician) (1734-1813), British army officer, businessman and politician in Upper Canada * Amy Grant (born 1960), American singer-songwriter * Anne Grant (1755-1838), Scottish poet * Anthony Grant (born 1966), American basketball coach * Anthony Grant (disambiguation), several people * Athena Grant, LAPD sergeant on TV series 9-1-1 * Audrey Grant (born 1940), Canadian bridge player * Avram Grant (born 1955), Israeli football manager * Ben Grant, Australian film producer * Bernie Grant (1944-2000), British politician * Beth Grant (born 1949), American actress * Bob Grant (disambiguation), several people * Boyd Grant (1933-2020), American basketball player and coach * Brian Grant (born 1972), American basketball player * Bud Grant (born 1927), American football coach * Bunny Grant (born 1940), Jamaican boxer of the 1950s, '60s and '70s * Cary Grant (1904-1986), British-American film actor * Chapman Grant (1887-1983), American biologist * Charles Grant (disambiguation), several people * Christopher Grant (disambiguation), several people * Claudius B.
