The 2001 Aston by-election was held in the Australian electorate of Aston in Victoria on 14 July 2001. The by-election was triggered by the death of the sitting member, the Liberal Party of Australia's Peter Nugent, on 24 April 2001. The writ for the by-election was issued on 1 June 2001. ==Background== The by-election was an important one for the Liberal Party. The federal Liberal government had introduced a controversial Goods and Services Tax just over a year before, and unpopular sentiment surrounding the government and its GST were believed to have led to the defeat of the Coalition in Western Australia and Queensland state elections in landslide defeats.Coorey, Phillip: No glorious July for PM this year, The Sydney Morning Herald, 13 July 2007. The Liberals had also lost the seat of Ryan in a recent by-election, and the ALP led by Kim Beazley was ahead in opinion polls. ==Results== ==Aftermath== Chris Pearce won the by-election, retaining Aston for the Liberal Party, but with a swing of 3.66 against them. Prime Minister John Howard appeared on the first episode of the ABC program Insiders the next day, where he suggested that Labor's electoral momentum had been held in check, and the government was back in the game: ==See also== * List of Australian federal by-elections ==References== ==External links== *Aston (VIC) By-Election (14 July 2001) Results, Australian Electoral Commission Category:2001 elections in Australia Category:Victorian federal by-elections Category:July 2001 events in Oceania Category:2000s in Victoria (Australia)
