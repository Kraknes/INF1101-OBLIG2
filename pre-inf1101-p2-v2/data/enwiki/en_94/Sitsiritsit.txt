Sitsiritsit, also known as Sitsiritsit Alibangbang, is a Filipino folk song. This humorous song describes a flirtatious woman threatening a storeowner that the ants are going to get him if he is not going to extend credit, as well as unusual situations of exchanging a child for a doll or bagoong. It is said to have originated during the country's Spanish colonization, as its lyrics suggest the ordinary life during that time. The melody of the song is about the same as Fly Fly the Butterfly. ==Lyrics== > Sitsiritsit, alibangbang > Salaginto, salagubang. > Ang babae sa lansangan > Kung gumiri'y parang tandang. > Santo Nino sa Pandacan > Puto seco sa tindahan > Kung ayaw kang magpautang > Uubusin ka ng langgam. > Mama, mama namamangka > Pasakayin yaring bata > Pagdating sa Maynila > Ipagpalit sa manika > Ale, aleng namamayong, > Pasukubin yaring sanggol > Pagdating sa Malabon, > Ipagpalit sa bagoong. > ==English Translation== > Cicada, Butterfly > Jeweled beetle, beetle > A woman on the street, > Sways her hips like a rooster. > > Child Jesus of Pandacan, > Rice cakes on the store. > If you are not giving credits, > The ants will eat all your goodies. > > Mister, Mister, rowing a boat, > Please take this naughty child for a ride. > Once you reach Manila, > Trade the child for a doll. > > Miss, Miss, holding an umbrella, > Please take this baby. > Once you reach Malabon, > Trade the baby for shrimp paste ==Popular culture== *In the children's program Batibot, there are two alien puppets named Sitsiritsit and Alibangbang who love discovering new things, places, and people around them.Batibot Muppets' Home Page Philippine Children's Television Foundation, Inc.
