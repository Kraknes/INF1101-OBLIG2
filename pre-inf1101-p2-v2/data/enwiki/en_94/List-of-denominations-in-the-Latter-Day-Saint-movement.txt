An 1842 portrait of Joseph Smith (1805-1844), founder of the Latter Day Saint movement The list of denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement includes: * The original church within this movement, founded in April 1830 in New York by Joseph Smith, was the Church of Christ, which was later named the Church of the Latter Day Saints. It was renamed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1838 (stylized as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the United Kingdom),See, for example, A collection of sacred hymns for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in Europe. which remained its official name until Smith's death in 1844. This organization subsequently splintered into several different denominations, each of which claims to be the legitimate continuation of this original church, and most of which dispute the right of other denominations within the movement to claim this distinction. * The largest denomination within the contemporary movement goes by the legal name of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) (see the history of the name of the church here). With over 16.5 million members as of 2019, it is the largest of the various denominations claiming to be the heir of the original church.. It is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and uses the term members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or Latter-day Saints to describe its members (note the hyphenation and variation in capitalization usage). The church publicly emphasized its proper name with an official statementofficial statement on August 16, 2018 and a formal talkformal talk to its members on October 7, 2018. * The second-largest denomination is the Community of Christ (first named the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church) from 1872 to 2001), a Missouri-based, 250,000-member denomination. Though members of this church have traditionally been called Latter Day Saints (without the hyphen), the Community of Christ has more recently stated that it rejects the use of the term Saints as a designation for its members in any official reference or publication.Herald House Style Guide, an official publication of the Community of Christ. See under entry "Saints". * Other denominations within the movement either formed around various would-be successors to Smith, or else broke from denominations that did. These, together with the two denominations listed above, are detailed in the table of denominations within the Latter Day Saint movement, below. A Brighamite- centric timeline of formations and origins for most LDS denominations Though a few small factions broke with Smith's organization during his lifetime, he retained the allegiance of the vast majority of Latter Day Saints until his death in June 1844. Following Smith's death, the movement experienced a leadership crisis which led to a schism within the church. The largest group, which would become the LDS Church, followed Brigham Young, settling in what would become the Utah Territory. The second-largest faction, the RLDS Church, coalesced around Joseph Smith III, eldest son of Joseph Smith. Other would-be leaders included the senior surviving member of the First Presidency, Sidney Rigdon; the newly baptized James Strang from Wisconsin; and Alpheus Cutler, one of the Council of Fifty. Each of these men still retains a following as of 2014--however tiny it may be in some cases--and all of their organizations have experienced further schisms. Other claimants, such as Granville Hedrick, William Bickerton and Charles B. Thompson, later emerged to start still other factions, some of which have further subdivided. 12 denominations are listed in the following table. {| class="wikitable" |+Estimation of membership in the Latter Day Saint movement by denomination |The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) |16,565,036 |98.0110% |- |Community of Christ (RLDS) |250,301 |1.5038% |- |The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite) |23,200 |0.1394% |- |Church of Jesus Christ with the Elijah Message |12,500 |0.0751% |- |Apostolic United Brethren |10,000 |0.0601% |- |Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) |10,000 |0.0601% |- |Restoration Branches |10,000 |0.0601% |- |Church of Christ (Hedrickites) |7,310 |0.0439% |- |Fellowships of the remnants |5,000 |0.0300% |- |Church of Christ (Fettingite) |2,450 |0.0147% |- |Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite) |300 |0.0018% |- |Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite) |12 |0.0001% |} == Categorizing the churches == An 1851 tinted lithograph depicting the death of Joseph Smith in 1844 Given the large number of Latter Day Saint churches and their differing backgrounds, categorizing them can be difficult. A common approach in some histories and studies is to use Rocky Mountain Saints for those denominations headquartered in the American West and Prairie Saints for those denominations that formed in and around Nauvoo, Illinois; Voree, Wisconsin; Independence, Missouri; and other locations in the Midwest and East. These terms do not necessarily relate the current geographical locations of all denominations within those two groupings, but rather the original location of their respective parent organizations, which may be seen in the table below. Another method uses provenance: for instance, all denominations that ultimately trace their history back to the LDS Church in Utah are organized as one factional group. Divergent Paths of the Restoration--a reference work on this subject--follows this approach. In such studies, as well as in general Latter Day Saint parlance, the -ite-suffixed terms Josephite and Brighamite have been used for the Missouri-based Community of Christ and the Utah-based LDS Church, respectively; these terms have sometimes been used to distinguish groups of denominations. Those denominations within each group share a common ancestry and basic beliefs that are different from groups sharing other provenances. The present article, in a similar fashion, distinguishes among groups of denominations by use of commonly understood names such as Mormon fundamentalist or else by short descriptions that often reference a founder of the first church within a factional group--for example, Joseph Smith III in reference to Community of Christ and various churches and factions that trace their origin to it. ==List of Latter Day Saint movement churches== ===Era of Joseph Smith=== Smith's original church, and those bodies which broke with him during his lifetime. ====Original church within movement==== The original organization, founded as the Church of Christ by Smith in 1830, later called the Church of the Latter-Day Saints and then The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.Manuscript History of the Church, LDS Church Archives, book A-1, p. 37; reproduced in Dean C.
