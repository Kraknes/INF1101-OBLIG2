Its core departments- English, Social Studies, Math, and Science- are based on a tiered system in order to allow for the variety of student capabilities, from Survey and Academic classes to Honors and Advanced Placement classes. Due to its extremely well credentialed faculty (over 65% possess a master's degree or higher), Kennett is able to offer a relatively large number of Advanced Placement courses.http://khs.kcsd.org/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=1002&Itemid;=254 Advanced Placement English Literature is offered to seniors who have completed Honors English 11 and to other recommended students. Honors Survey (9th), World (10th), American (11th) and British (12th) Literature courses are designed to challenge academically motivated, high-achieving students. Advanced Literature courses and the 12th grade semester genre are designed for college-bound students. Both levels emphasize literature analysis, the writing process, and vocabulary development. Entrance into these classes is dependent upon A or B level achievement and teacher recommendation. The Social Studies sequence is World Studies I, World Studies II, American Studies, Economics and American Government. Honors courses are taught in World Studies I, World Studies II, and Economics. AP U.S. History and AP American Government can fulfill the American Studies and American Government requirements. AP European is an elective choice for students in tenth, eleventh, or twelfth grade. The most rigorous mathematics sequence, beginning with Algebra in eighth grade, permits students to study AP Calculus (AB and BC) or Calculus in twelfth grade. The traditional college preparatory mathematics sequence concludes with Mathematics Analysis in twelfth grade. Because of student transfers or development in mathematics, it is possible for students to have some courses in both sequences. AP Statistics is an elective choice for students who have successfully completed Algebra II. The science sequence is Earth and Space (9th), Biology (10th), Chemistry (11th), Physics (12th). Honors level courses in each of these curricula are substantially more rigorous and are designed to challenge academically motivated, high-achieving students. Both levels of science courses offer similar topics and labs. AP Physics will fulfill the 12th grade physics requirements. Students may elect AP Biology, AP Chemistry, or AP Computer Science. Some students are able to enroll in two science courses within the same year. It is almost impossible to schedule more than two. The following AP courses are available: English Literature and Composition, United States History, Government and Politics: United States, European History, Biology, Chemistry, Physics C: Mechanics, Music Theory, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, Statistics, Computer Science A, French Language, German Language, Latin: Vergil, Spanish Language. The languages offered at Kennett High School are French, Spanish, Latin, and German. ESL (English as a Second Language) programs are in place for Spanish-speaking immigrants. There are no Honors level I languages. There are no regular level II-IV languages, only Honors level or AP. Students may begin their study of a world language in eighth grade. Students must take at least 2 years (or earn 2 credits) of a foreign language in order to graduate. Students whose first language is one other than English are eligible for support services through the ESL program. A language skills assessment will determine English fluency. Students will then receive direct instruction in English language and reading. As students master English, they will continue to receive academic support. Students are exited from the ESL instructional program based on federal assessment guidelines. ===Program rating=== According to a Newsweek list released in 2010, Kennett was named as one of America's best high schools.
