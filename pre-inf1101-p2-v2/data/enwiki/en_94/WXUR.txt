On July 20, 1994, WYUT and WYUT-FM returned to the air after a 3-year hiatus and WYUT-FM changed its call sign to the current WXUR, while the AM became WNRS.http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=2761&Callsign;=WXUR WXUR FCC Call Sign History The station broadcast a satellite oldies format with Don Imus in the morning before switching to Active Rock and bringing in Bill Keeler to handle mornings. The station, which then adopted its current branding of The Drive, switched to Classic Hits then Adult Rock after Galaxy Communications, which formerly owned WRCK (Rock 107), took over WOUR, spun off WRCK to the Educational Media Foundation, and began programming WOUR from Syracuse. WXUR hired former WRCK (Rock 107) morning host Frank McBride to handle afternoons, returned the popular Bob & Tom Show (formerly on WOUR) to the market and also added former WOUR veterans Tom Starr, Rick Devoe and Alison to the line-up that already included market mainstay Jack Moran. Jerry Kraus, another market mainstay, when WOUR was broadcasting from Utica, joined the station for weekends in 2012. After Frank McBride's sudden death, WXUR completed the migration down the dial of the WOUR airstaff by hiring 'Genesee' Joe Trisolino to take over the afternoon show and Dave Phoenix, who is also WXUR's Senior Account Executive, to host the weeknight 7pm to Midnight slot. As of Spring 2018, Tom Starr and Dave Phoenix left the station. Jack Moran died in April 2018. ==References== ==External links== * XUR Category:Classic rock radio stations in the United States
