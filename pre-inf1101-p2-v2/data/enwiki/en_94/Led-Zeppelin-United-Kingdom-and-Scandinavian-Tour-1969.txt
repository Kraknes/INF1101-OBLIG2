Led Zeppelin's 1969 tour of the United Kingdom and Scandinavia was a concert tour of the United Kingdom and Scandinavia by the English rock band. The tour commenced on 1 March and concluded on 17 April 1969. During this tour, Led Zeppelin made a number of live television appearances, including one date in Denmark on 17 March,Led Zeppelin official website: concert summary a session at BBC TV studios on March 21Led Zeppelin official website: concert summary and a session at Staines on March 25,Led Zeppelin official website: concert summary the last for the filming of the Supershow. Some of these early filmed sessions were later released on the Led Zeppelin DVD (2003). They were part of manager Peter Grant's early strategy to build public awareness of the group. However, his dissatisfaction with the medium (particularly its inferior audio quality), would soon lead him to make the band unavailable for television again.Lewis, Dave and Pallett, Simon (1997) Led Zeppelin: The Concert File, London: Omnibus Press. , p. 20. Led Zeppelin's debut album was belatedly released in the United Kingdom part-way through this tour, in late March 1969. ==Tour set list== The fairly typical set list for the tour was: #"Train Kept A-Rollin'" (Bradshaw, Kay, Mann) #"I Can't Quit You Baby" (Dixon) #"I Gotta Move" (on 14 March and 16 March only) #"Dazed and Confused" (Page) #"As Long As I Have You" (Mimms) #"Killing Floor" (Wolf) #"White Summer"/"Black Mountain Side" (Page) #"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You" (Bredon, Page, Plant) #"You Shook Me" (Dixon, Lenoir) #"How Many More Times" (Bonham, Jones, Page) #"Communication Breakdown" (Bonham, Jones, Page) #"Pat's Delight" (Bonham) There were some set list substitutions, variations, and order switches during the tour.
