Beyond the Years () is a 2007 South Korean drama film. Celebrating director Im Kwon-taek's 100th film, it is based on the short fiction "The Wanderer of Seonhak-dong" by Lee Cheong-jun, and was presented at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. Despite being an informal sequel to Im's phenomenally successful Sopyonje (1993), Beyond the Years was not popular with Korean audiences. ==Synopsis== Dong-ho and Song-hwa are separately adopted by Yu-bong (Im Jin-taek), a nomadic singer, and grow up as siblings. Dong-ho falls in love with Song-hwa, but he suffers from the fact that he has to call her sister and constantly fight with Yu-bong's obsession to make her a great singer. Eventually, Dong-ho leaves home. However, with his unchanging affection for Song-hwa, he keeps following traces of his love while refining his drumming skills in order to match well with her singing. This is the heart-touching love story of Song-hwa, who devotes her life and love to her talent for Pansori (a traditional Korean form of narrative song), and Dong-ho, who has devoted his life to loving her. ==Cast== *Cho Jae-hyun *Oh Jung-hae *Ryu Seung-ryong *Oh Seung-eun *Im Jin-taek *Jang Min-ho *Go Soo-hee ==References== == External links == * * * Category:2007 films Category:2007 drama films Category:South Korean films Category:South Korean drama films Category:Films about blind people Category:Films based on short fiction Category:Films directed by Im Kwon-taek Category:Korean-language films
