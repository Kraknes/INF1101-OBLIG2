The Regionalliga Sud was the second-highest level of the German football league system. It existed in the south of Germany from 1963 until the formation of the 2. Bundesliga in 1974. It covered the three states of Bavaria, Baden-Wurttemberg and Hessen. ==Overview== The league started out in 1963 with 20 clubs which were reduced for the next season to 19. From 1965 to 1974, there were always 18 teams in the league, except in 1972 when another season of 19 clubs was played. It was formed from the eleven clubs of the Oberliga Sud which did not get admitted to the new Bundesliga and from the top nine clubs of the 2. Oberliga Sud. The Regionalliga Sud was as such a continuation of the Oberliga Sud under a different name and a tier lower. Along with the Regionalliga Sud went another four Regionalligas, these five formed the second tier of German football until 1974: *Regionalliga Nord, covering the states of Niedersachsen, Schleswig-Holstein, Bremen and Hamburg *Regionalliga West, covering the state of Nordrhein-Westfalen *Regionalliga Berlin, covering West-Berlin *Regionalliga Sudwest, covering the states of Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland The new Regionalligas were formed along the borders of the old post-World War II Oberligas, not after a balanced regional system. Therefore, the Oberligas Berlin and West covered small but populous areas while Nord and Sud covered large areas. Sudwest was something of an anachronism, neither large nor populous. The league contained some big names of German Football, having the FC Bayern Munich, Kickers Offenbach and SpVgg Furth as its founder members. In later years, clubs like TSV 1860 Munich, 1. FC Nurnberg and Karlsruher SC found themselves relegated to the league. The league posed something of a death trap for the big names of southern German football, as only the FC Bayern Munich and Kickers Offenbach achieved promotion from it. Kickers Offenbach also managed to win the German Cup in 1970, while still a Regionalliga side, the only club to do so. The FC Schweinfurt 05, SpVgg Furth, Stuttgarter Kickers, KSV Hessen Kassel, Freiburger FC and FC Bayern Hof all played in the league for the duration of its 11-season existence. Of those six, the Stuttgarter Kickers had the longest unbroken run in the second division, from 1960 to 1988, 28 seasons. The winners and runners-up of this league were admitted to the promotion play-off to the Bundesliga, which was staged in two groups of originally four, later five teams each with the winner of each group going up. The bottom three, some years four teams were relegated to the Amateurligas. Below the Regionalliga Sud were the following Amateurligas: * Amateurliga Bayern * Amateurliga Hessen * Amateurliga Nordwurttemberg * Amateurliga Schwarzwald-Bodensee * Amateurliga Nordbaden * Amateurliga Sudbaden ==Disbanding of the Regionalliga Sud == The league was dissolved in 1974. According to their performance of the last couple of seasons, 13 clubs of the Regionalliga went to the new 2. Bundesliga Sud. The five remaining clubs were relegated to the Amateurligas. The teams admitted to the 2. Bundesliga Sud were: *FC Augsburg (Champions) *1. FC Nurnberg (Runners-up) *TSV 1860 Munich (3rd) *SV Darmstadt 98 (4th) *SpVgg Bayreuth (5th) *Stuttgarter Kickers (6th) *SV Waldhof Mannheim (7th) *Karlsruher SC (8th) *FC Bayern Hof (9th) *SpVgg Furth (10th) *VfR Heilbronn (12th) *VfR Mannheim (13th) *FC Schweinfurt 05 (15th) The following teams were relegated to the Amateurligas: *FSV Frankfurt (11th) - Amateurliga Hessen *VfR Burstadt (14th) - Amateurliga Hessen *Hessen Kassel (16th) - Amateurliga Hessen *Freiburger FC (17th) - Amateurliga Sudbaden *Jahn Regensburg (18th) - Amateurliga Bayern ==Qualifying to the 2. Bundesliga== From the Regionalliga Sud, 13 clubs qualified for the new 2. Bundesliga Sud, together with seven teams from the Sudwest region. The qualifying modus saw the last five seasons counted, whereby the last placed team in each season received one point, the second-last two points and so on. For a Bundesliga season within this five- year period, a club received 25 points, for an Amateurliga season none. For the seasons 1969-70 and 70-71, the received points counted single, for the 71-72 and 72-73 season double and for the 73-74 season three times. To be considered in the points table for the new league, a club had to play either in the Regionalliga Sud in 1973-74 or to have been relegated from the Bundesliga to it for the next season, something which did not apply to the league that year. The bottom three clubs in the league, nominally the relegated teams in a normal season, were barred from entry to the 2. Bundesliga, regardless of where they stood in the points ranking. This fact saved the FC Augsburg, the last league champion, from relegation, as Hessen Kassel, placed ninth overall but having finished 16th in 1973-74 was barred from promotion, opening the way for FCA.Die Deutsche Liga-Chronik seit 1945 - History of German league football since 1945 publisher: DSFS, published: 2006, page: C3 + C4 Points table: {| class="wikitable" |- align="center" bgcolor="#dfdfdf" | Rank | Club | Points 1969-74 | Place in 1973-74 |- align="center" | 1 | TSV 1860 Munich | 155 | 3 |- align="center" | 2 | 1.

In something of a repeat of history, the clubs from the Oberliga Sudwest merged into the league in 2000. The Regionalliga Sud now roughly covered the same area as the 2nd Bundesliga Sud did from 1974 to 1981. In 2008, the Sudwest clubs will leave the league again and join the new Regionalliga West and the Regionalliga Sud will revert to its coverage of the three original regions, but now as the fourth tier of the league system, below the new 3. Liga. ==Winners and runners-up of the Regionalliga Sud== The winners and runners-up of the league were:"Kicker Almanach" The Football Yearbook on German football from Bundesliga to Oberliga, since 1937, published by the kicker Sports Magazine {| class="wikitable" |- align="center" bgcolor="#FFD700" |width="70"|Season |width="150"|Winner |width="150"|Runner-Up |- align="center" | 1963-64 | Hessen Kassel | FC Bayern Munich |- align="center" | 1964-65 | FC Bayern Munich | SSV Reutlingen |- align="center" | 1965-66 | FC Schweinfurt 05 | Kickers Offenbach |- align="center" | 1966-67 | Kickers Offenbach | FC Bayern Hof |- align="center" | 1967-68 | FC Bayern Hof | Kickers Offenbach |- align="center" | 1968-69 | Karlsruher SC | Freiburger FC |- align="center" | 1969-70 | Kickers Offenbach | Karlsruher SC |- align="center" | 1970-71 | 1.
