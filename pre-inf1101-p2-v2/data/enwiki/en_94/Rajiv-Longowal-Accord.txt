The Rajiv-Longowal Accord, was an accord signed by then Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi and Akali leader of Punjab Harchand Singh Longowal on 24 July 1985.

Harchand Singh Longowal was assassinated by the Sikh militants opposed to the accord. ==Provisions== The following were the provisions of the accord: {| class="wikitable" ! S. No. ! Provision !

However, Gurcharan Singh Tohra (SGPC President) and Prakash Singh Badal opposed every clause of the accord. Even after a meeting between Longowal, Tohra, Badal and Surjit Singh Barnala, the differences persisted. On 25 July, a group of Akali Dal leaders rejected the accord, calling it a "sell-out". Joginder Singh, the father of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, presided over an Akali Dali meeting, where he described Longowal, Barnala and Balwant Singh as traitors to the Sikh panth.

After a rally in Rohtak, 29 members of the Haryana State Assembly resigned on 9 August. The protesters objected to the following: * Consideration being given to the Anandpur Sahib Resolution, which the protestors believed to be the root cause of the trouble in Punjab * Soft treatment being meted out to those who had deserted the Army * "Absolutely vague" settlement regarding which territories would be transferred to Haryana in lieu of Chandigarh * Imposition of a ceiling on the use of the Ravi-Beas waters as per the current use: the protesters pointed out that Punjab was using more water than its allocated share, while Haryana was using less water than its share * Uncertainty regarding who will control the headworks ==See also== *Indira-Sheikh Accord ==References== ==External links== * Rajiv- Longowal Memorandum of Settlement (Accord), 24 July 1985 Category:1980s in Punjab, India Category:Insurgency in Punjab Category:1985 in India
