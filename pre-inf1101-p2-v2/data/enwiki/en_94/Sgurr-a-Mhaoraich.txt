Sgurr a' Mhaoraich is a Scottish mountain located to the north of Loch Quoich in the north western highlands. It has a height of 1027 m (3369 ft) and is classed as a Munro. Viewed from Kinloch Hourn to the west, or from the north, it shows large, steep, rocky flanks with a complex series of ridges and corries, but like its neighbours such as Gleouraich, its southern side is gentler and grassier.The Munros (SMC Guide), Donald Bennett et al., The mountain was originally known as Sgurr a' Mhoraire, meaning peak of the landowner, but has been changed on modern maps to Sgurr a' Mhaoraich, which may be derived from the Gaelic maorach meaning shellfish. This may be a reference to the hill's ribbed summit, which has been said to resemble a shell.Trout and about on a wet day by Loch Quoich, Robin Howie, The Scotsman, 8 April 2006 The mountain is most commonly climbed from the shores of Loch Quioch to the south. A stalker's path leads up the Bac nan Canaichean ridge to the subsidiary top of Sgurr Coire nan Eiricheallach (), which is connected to the main summit by a 1.5 km ridge, which has a number of rocky outcrops which can be scrambled over or bypassed. An alternative, and less frequently climbed route is from the northeast end of Glen Quoich, by way of a stalker's path which runs the length of Coire a' Carorainn and to the rocky summit of An Bathaich (), and from there south to Sgurr a' Mhaoraich via a high bealach.The Munros: Scotland's Highest Mountains, Cameron McNeish, ==References== Category:Munros Category:Marilyns of Scotland Category:Mountains and hills of the Northwest Highlands Category:One-thousanders of the British Isles
