is a Japanese manufacturer of billiards and pool cue tips. Originally fabricated by hand by founder Hideo Moori in his home outside Tokyo, they are now produced in a factory. The tips are exclusively made from vegetable-tanned pig skin, and consist of several thin layers bonded with an adhesive. Moori was among the first to use a lamination technique to make a cue tip. Moori tips received their first major exposure during the WPA World Nine-ball Championship in October 1994, and prompted many other companies to begin manufacturing layered tips. Currently, Moori makes tips in three degrees of hardness: slow (soft), medium, and quick (hard). ==References== Category:Cue sports equipment manufacturers Category:Manufacturing companies based in Tokyo Category:1983 establishments in Japan Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1983
