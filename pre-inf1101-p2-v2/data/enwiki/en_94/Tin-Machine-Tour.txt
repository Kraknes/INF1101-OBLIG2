The Tin Machine Tour was a concert tour headlined by Anglo-American hard rock band Tin Machine. The tour commenced on 14 June 1989, following a performance of "Heaven's in Here" at the International Music Awards in New York City on 31 May 1989. It comprised 12 performances in six countries (USA, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, France, United Kingdom) in venues with a capacity of 2,000 or less. Joined onstage by Kevin Armstrong, Tin Machine performed the entirety of their eponymous debut album with the exception of "Video Crime," augmented with cover version of songs from Bob Dylan and Johnny Kidd & The Pirates. ==Tour performance details== The band played in "fashionable black suits" in front of stark lighting in what was described as a departure from Bowie's previous tour. The 17 June show was added at the last minute when Bowie saw the long lines for tickets to 16 June's performance; the show was at midnight (technically the night of 16 June) and tickets were sold at half- price. For 24 June's performance in Amsterdam, video screens were erected outside the venue for those unable to obtain tickets.Nicholas Pegg, The Complete David Bowie, Reynolds & Hearn Ltd, 2004, The video for "Maggie's Farm" was recorded at the same venue. ==Live recordings== The 25 June performance at La Cigale, Paris was recorded with excerpts broadcast on Westwood One FM radio. Four songs from the same performance were released as b-sides to the 1989 singles; "Tin Machine" and "Prisoner of Love." 8 songs performed at this show were released digitally on the album Live at La Cigale, Paris, 25th June, 1989 in August 2019, to coincide with the album's 30th anniversary. The digital release was mastered by original album producer Tim Palmer. ==Tour reviews== The Los Angeles Times had a positive review of Tin Machine's first show of the tour in New York City, saying "the band was full of life, raucous and brash, good-natured and smart." Rolling Stone described fans who had gone to see "the Thin White Duke crooning 'Young Americans'" as receiving a rude awakening as Bowie offered "no oldies, no encores and no apologies." Reactions to the US shows were mixed as fans and critics felt that the proximity to Bowie was often more exciting than the music the band was playing. Ultimately, Rolling Stone magazine stated that it was Bowie's presence that "elevated the songs from the level of average grunge to that of theatrical avant-garage rock", and later said it helped Bowie regain some of the credibility he had lost during his previous album and tour. ==Tour band== * David Bowie - vocals, guitar * Reeves Gabrels - guitar * Tony Sales - bass guitar, vocals * Hunt Sales - drums, vocals ;Additional musicians * Kevin Armstrong - rhythm guitar (Blah Blah Blah, Tin Machine, Tin Machine II) ==Tour dates== * 14 June 1989 The World - New York City, United States > SET LIST: Sacrifice Yourself, Heaven's in Here, Amazing, Working Class Hero, > Tin Machine, Sorry, > Prisoner of Love, Bus Stop (country version), Bus Stop, I Can't Read, You've > Been Around, Baby > Can Dance, Run, Crack City, Pretty Thing, Under The God * 16 June 1989 The Roxy - Los Angeles, California, United States > SET LIST: Sacrifice Yourself, Heaven's in Here, Amazing, Working Class Hero, > Tin Machine, Prisoner of > Love, Sorry, Bus Stop, Bus Stop (country version), Run, I Can't Read, Baby > Can Dance, Pretty Thing, > Crack City, Under The God * 17 June 1989 The Roxy - Los Angeles, California, United States > SET LIST: Sacrifice Yourself, Heaven's in Here, Working Class Hero, Sorry, > Bus Stop (country version), > Bus Stop, I Can't Read, Run, Pretty Thing, Crack City, Baby Can Dance, Under > The God * 21 June 1989 Saga Rockteatre - Copenhagen, Denmark > SET LIST: Sacrifice Yourself, Heaven's in Here, Amazing, Working Class Hero, > Tin Machine, Prisoner of > Love, Sorry, Bus Stop (country version), Bus Stop, Run, I Can't Read, Baby > Can Dance, Pretty Thing, > Crack City, Under The God * 22 June 1989 Docks - Hamburg, Germany > SET LIST: Amazing, Sacrifice Yourself, Heaven's in Here, Working Class Hero, > Tin Machine, Sorry, > Bus Stop, Bus Stop (country version), Run, Maggie's Farm, Baby Can Dance, I > Can't Read, Pretty > Thing, Crack City, Under The God * 24 June 1989 Paradiso - Amsterdam, Netherlands > SET LIST: Amazing, Sacrifice Yourself, Heaven's in Here, Working Class Hero, > Prisoner of Love, > Tin Machine, Sorry, Bus Stop (country version), Bus Stop, Run, Maggie's > Farm, I Can't Read, > Baby Can Dance, Pretty Thing, Crack City, Under The God * 25 June 1989 La Cigale - Paris, France > SET LIST: Amazing, Heaven's in Here, Sacrifice Yourself, Working Class Hero, > Prisoner of Love, Tin > Machine, Sorry, Bus Stop (country version), Bus Stop, Run, Maggie's Farm, I > Can't Read, Baby Can > Dance, Pretty Thing, Crack City, Under The God Opening Band : La Place (France) Local Promoter : Alain Lahana * 27 June 1989 The Town & Country Club - London, England > SET LIST: Amazing, Heaven's in Here, Sacrifice Yourself, Working Class Hero, > Prisoner of Love, Sorry, > Bus Stop, Run, Maggie's Farm, I Can't Read, Baby Can Dance, Pretty Thing, > Crack City, Under The God Opening Band : Jesus Jones (UK) * 29 June 1989 National Ballroom - Kilburn, London, England > SET LIST: Bus Stop (country version), Bus Stop, Amazing, Working Class Hero, > Sacrifice Yourself, > Heaven's in Here, Prisoner of Love, Sorry, Now, Run, Baby Can Dance, Tin > Machine, Maggie's > Farm, I Can't Read, Shakin' All Over, Pretty Thing, Crack City, Under The > God * 1 July 1989 Newport Leisure Centre - Newport, Wales > SET LIST: Amazing, Heaven's in Here, Sacrifice Yourself, Working Class Hero, > Prisoner of Love, Sorry, > Bus Stop (country version), Bus Stop, Shakin' All Over, Run, Baby Can Dance, > I Can't Read, Maggie's > Farm, Pretty Thing, Crack City, Under The God * 2 July 1989 St. George's Hall - Bradford, England > SET LIST: Now, Amazing, Heaven's in Here, Bus Stop (country version), Bus > Stop, Working Class Hero, > Prisoner of Love, Sacrifice Yourself, Sorry, Run, I Can't Read, Maggie's > Farm, Tin Machine, Baby Can > Dance, Shakin' All Over, Pretty Thing, Crack City, Under The God * 3 July 1989 The Forum - Livingston, Scotland > SET LIST: Amazing, Heaven's in Here, Working Class Hero, Shakin' All Over, > Sorry, Sacrifice Yourself, > Bus Stop (country version), Bus Stop, Run, I Can't Read, Maggie's Farm, Baby > Can Dance, Tin Machine, > Pretty Thing, Crack City, Under The God ==The songs== From Tin Machine * "Heaven's in Here" * "Tin Machine" (Bowie, Reeves Gabrels, Hunt Sales, Tony Sales) * "Prisoner of Love" (Bowie, Gabrels, H.
