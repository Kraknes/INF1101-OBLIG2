"'Sexual Eruption", also known by the censored version title "Sensual Seduction", is a song by American hip hop recording artist Snoop Dogg. It was released on November 20, 2007 as the first single of his ninth studio album Ego Trippin, with the record label Geffen Records. The song was produced by Shawty Redd. Snoop Dogg sings the majority of the song using Auto-Tune. The video's style visually references the style of Roger Troutman, as part of its retro imagery.Sucker Free >> Snoop Dogg On His "Sensual Seduction" Throwback Video This is his first Top 10 as a solo artist since 2004's "Drop It Like It's Hot". ==Writing and background== Snoop Dogg originally heard the single "Drifter", produced by Atlanta-based producer Fatboi, and was prepared to purchase the song. Snoop Dogg's cousin -- So So Def affiliate rapper-producer Daz Dillinger -- began to facilitate mediations between the two artists. Dillinger, in a good connection with Shawty Redd, organized an arrangement in which Shawty agreed to send Dillinger the rights, but also offered to make an exclusive track for Snoop with a similar sound to that of "Drifter". Daz also organized an audition meeting for the two while Snoop was touring Georgia. Shawty Redd was unable to attend the meeting, but later conversed about the beat with Snoop via telephone. He sent a demo instrumental to Los Angeles, and was ultimately surprised by the changes Snoop made to the track. Originally, Redd didn't intend to use the auto-tuned effect on the vocals. The tape was sent back, vocals included, and Shawty began to play it in his local club.Interviews - Shawty Redd The song was leaked in early October 2007.
