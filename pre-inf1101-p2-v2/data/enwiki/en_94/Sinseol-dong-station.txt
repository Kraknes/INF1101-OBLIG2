Sinseol-dong Station is a station on the Seoul Subway Line 1, the Seongsu Branch of Seoul Subway Line 2, and Ui LRT. There is a piece of track that connects the Line 1 and Line 2 stations, and Line 1 trains belonging to Seoul Metro are serviced at the Gunja Train Depot behind Yongdap Station using this connective track. The B3 floor features an unused one-track platform. This used to be the original Line 2 platform. However, due to intermittent flooding, this platform was closed off, and a new platform on the B2 floor serves as the current Line 2 station. The track passing through this unused platform is currently used by Line 1 trains running light from Dongmyo Station to the Gunja Train Depot. ==Gallery== Seoul-metro-126-Sinseol-dong-station- platform-20181122-113312.jpg|Line 1 platform ==References== Category:Seoul Metropolitan Subway stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1974 Category:Metro stations in Dongdaemun District Category:1974 establishments in South Korea
