In the mid-1960s he became involved with the Cork minor hurling side. He coached the team to win six Munster titles in-a-row between 1966 and 1971. These provincial wins were converted into four All-Ireland titles in the same period. During the same period Troy was hugely involved with Cork's under-21 hurlers. He guided them to a record four Munster and four All-Ireland titles in-a-row between 1968 and 1971. Many of the players that he coached at these levels went on to form the backbone of the Cork senior team in the mid-1970s. ===Cork=== In 1975 Troy was joint-coach of the senior hurling team with Justin McCarthy, before being appointed coach/manager in his own right the following year. In this capacity he steered the team to a record five Munster titles in-a-row. These were converted into a remarkable three All-Ireland titles in-a-row in 1976, 1977 and 1978, thus making Troy one of the most successful managers of the modern era.The Late Canon Troy HoganStand, 30 January 2007.
