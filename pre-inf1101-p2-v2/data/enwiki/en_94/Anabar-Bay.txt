At that time it was a very little-known area of the Russian Arctic. He was the first one to map the plateau between the Anabar and Popigay Rivers. There were two settlements in the Anabar Bay area, during Soviet times. One was Khorgo, at the mouth of the bay, and the other Tostuya, further inland at the point where the estuarine area begins. ==See also== *Russian polar expedition of 1900-1902 *Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition *Russian Hydrographic Service ==References== *Geology *Natural History and pictures ==External links== * The Siberian Sea Road: The Work of the Russian Hydrographical Expedition to the Arctic 1910-1915 * Zapiski Kharitona Lapteva (Exploration of the area) * Pictures of the Bay Category:Gulfs of Russia Category:Gulfs of the Laptev Sea Category:Bays of the Sakha Republic Category:Bays of the Laptev Sea
