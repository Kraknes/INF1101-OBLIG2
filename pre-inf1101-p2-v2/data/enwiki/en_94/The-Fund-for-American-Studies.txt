The Fund for American Studies is a non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1967, the organization's mission is "to change the world by developing leaders for a free society." ==History== The Fund for American Studies headquarters located in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. In 1967, Charles Edison took the first steps toward establishing the institution that is known today as The Fund for American Studies. Edison was a former governor of New Jersey, Secretary of the Navy, and son of inventor Thomas Alva Edison. Concerned about an eroding confidence in the American system of government, Edison recruited Walter H. Judd, David R. Jones, Marvin Liebman, and William F. Buckley Jr. to build a program that would educate college students about American government, politics, and economics. On February 6, 1967, the group incorporated the Charles Edison Youth Fund. In 1969, Edison died suddenly. To honor him and carry on his mission, the organization was renamed the Charles Edison Memorial Youth Fund. In 1985, the organization was renamed again to its present-day title, The Fund for American Studies. In the summer of 1970, the Edison Fund organized the inaugural Institute on Comparative Political and Economic Systems. Fifty-seven students attended the first Institute. ===Organizational timeline === {| class="wikitable" |- | 1967 | The Charles Edison Youth Fund is founded in Washington, D.C. |- | 1969 | The organization renames itself the Charles Edison Memorial Youth Fund following the sudden death of Governor Edison. |- | 1970 | The Institute on Comparative Political and Economic Systems (ICPES) in Washington, D.C., is established |- | 1985 | The Charles Edison Memorial Youth Fund is renamed "The Fund for American Studies" |- | 1985 | The Institute on Political Journalism (IPJ) in Washington, D.C., is established (now the Journalism + Communications program track) |- | 1990 | The Bryce Harlow Institute on Business and Government Affairs (IBGA) in Washington, D.C., is established (now the Business + Government Relations program track) |- | 1992 | ICPES renamed the "Engalitcheff Institute on Comparative Political and Economic Systems" to honor John Engalitcheff.
