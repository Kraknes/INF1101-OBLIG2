The Seven Sisters, part of the Holyoke Range and located within the Pioneer Valley region of Massachusetts, United States, are a series of basalt ridgeline knobs between Mount Holyoke and Mount Hitchcock (there are more than seven distinct peaks). The knobs offer scenic clifftop views interspersed with oak savanna woodlands. The highest "sister" has an elevation of and stands above the valley below. The terrain is very rugged; a continuous walk along the ridgeline includes an overall elevation change of . The Seven Sisters are traversed by the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail and is part of the New England National Scenic Trail The Seven Sisters are the location of the Seven Sisters Trail Race every spring, a twelve-mile (19 km) "out-and-back" run that often leaves its runners bloody, bruised and exhausted. In response to a proposed suburban development on the Seven Sisters in the late 1990s, several non- profit groups and local governments worked together to block construction and acquire the ridgeline for the J.A. Skinner State Park. Coincidentally, the seven sisters are near two of the Seven Sisters Colleges. ==See also== * Metacomet Ridge * Metacomet-Monadnock Trail * Robert Frost Trail (Massachusetts) ;Adjacent summits: {| border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" ! < West !!
