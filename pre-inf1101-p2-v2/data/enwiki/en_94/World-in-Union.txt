"World in Union", with lyrics by Charlie Skarbek, is a theme song for the Rugby World Cup that attempts to capture the spirit of international friendship which exemplifies rugby union culture the world over. The melody is "Thaxted"--the stately theme from the middle section of "Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity", a movement from Gustav Holst's "The Planets", and was originally adapted for its use in the British/Anglican patriotic hymn, "I Vow to Thee, My Country". ==Kiri Te Kanawa version== New Zealand operatic soprano Kiri Te Kanawa recorded the first version of this song for the 1991 Rugby World Cup, which went to No.4 in the UK Singles Chart. ==Shirley Bassey and Bryn Terfel version== Shirley Bassey and Bryn Terfel released a version of the song on 11 October 1999. It was controversially mimed live by at the opening of the series in June 1999, with Bassey famously wearing a gown designed on the Welsh flag. Three versions are featured on the CD single: a duet with Bassey and Terfel, Bassey's solo version and a version which features the choirs only. The duet version is performed partially in Welsh by Terfel. The official video was filmed at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff and features various other Welsh landscapes. The single marked a rare return to the UK Singles Chart for Bassey, where it reached #35 in October 1999.

The petition was featured on the front page of UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph. ==Kiyoe Yoshioka version== For the 2019 Rugby World Cup, the song was recorded by Japanese singer Kiyoe Yoshioka.
