Random Hand is a British ska band, formed in Keighley in 2002. Their sound fuses influences from many genres, including ska, reggae, punk rock, metal, hip hop and dub. The band is typically associated with the punk subculture, due to its ethics and lyrical content. Their lyrical themes are mostly of a sociopolitical nature, however recent albums Inhale/Exhale and Seething Is Believing, feature more personal lyrics and subject matter. == Biography == ===Early career=== Formed in late 2002, the original lineup consisted of Joe Tilston (bass and vocals), Robin Leitch (vocals and trombone), Matt Crosher (guitar and vocals) and Joe Dimuantes (percussion and samples). Random Hand played their first show on 31 December 2002 in a friend's basement in Haworth, with other shows around the West Yorkshire, namely in Huddersfield, Leeds and Halifax. In summer 2003, the band recorded a demo, which was given as a free release for download. In late 2004, the band spent time with producer TimG to record the On The March EP.The band set off on their first tour in January 2004 with Catch-it Kebabs and Zen Baseball Bat. This tour was soon followed by a self-booked UK tour in March to coincide with the release of their debut EP, On The March. The band then performed at events like Morcambe's Wasted Festival and shows with The Planet Smashers, Adequate Seven, Sonic Boom Six, Bad Manners, The Beat, Skindred and Babar Luck. The latter teamed up with the band in the studio to record two tracks. ===Change Of Plan=== The band began to be represented by Hidden Talent Booking in 2006. This saw Random Hand playing shows on Adequate Seven's final tour, Lightyear's reunion tour and the Three Way Dance with Sonic Boom Six, Failsafe and Crazy Arm, before heading to the studio to record their debut album Change of Plan. The record was released on Riot Music on 7 May 2007. Following the release, the band toured with Voodoo Glow Skulls, Grown at Home, The JB Conspiracy and Left Alone, and played at the festivals City Invasion, Rebellion and Leeds Festival. Songs from the album received regular play on the Mike Davies Show and were played on the Steve Lamacq Show, and the band recorded a session at Maida Vale Studios for the BBC Radio 1 Punk Show in late 2007. Their songs also appeared on several cover CDs for Big Cheese Magazine. In September 2007 Random Hand signed to independent music publisher Bomber Music 2008 started with the band's first headline tour of the UK, with 20 dates across the UK. The band then joined Voodoo Glow Skulls on their 2008 west coast United States tour. 2008 also saw performances at several festivals in the UK, in April at City Invasion in Bolton and London, and at the end of May as part of their tour with Sonic Boom Six and Big D and the Kids Table, and at Dunk Fest, Strummercamp and in August at Rebellion. The band appeared at the 2008 Reading and Leeds Festival on the Lock-Up stage. ===Inhale/Exhale=== In early September 2008, Random Hand announced the upcoming January 2009 release of their second album, Inhale/Exhale on Rebel Alliance Records. The band again worked with Change Of Plan's producer Peter Miles. Random Hand recorded the album in November 2008 and it was released in February. Touring with ska punk legends Reel Big Fish followed a 21 date January headline tour in support of the new album. Separate tours with Canadian punks Propagandhi and Manchester peers Sonic Boom Six took place in April and May 2009. Visibility and awareness of the second album in comparison to Change Of Plan increased with more investment from the band and new label. A video was released for debut single 'Anger Management', which was released on CD and download in September 2009. Prior to the release, the band embarked on a 14 date UK headline tour with UK reggae band The Skints. ===Seething Is Believing=== In late 2009, the band started writing material for a third album. During January and February 2010 the band took part in the Rebel Alliance Tour with The Skints, Mouthwash & Chris Murray, with all the bands having releases on Rebel Alliance Recordings. During this tour, drummer and founding member Joe Dimuantes decided to leave the band. The band took a few months out to practice with new drummer Sean Howe (formerly of The Wayriders and Out From Animals) and finish writing their third album. In the meantime, singer/trombonist Robin Leitch and bassist Joe Tilston played solo shows whilst the band took a break from touring. To make up for the shows missed due to van problems Random Hand played a clutch of "pay what you want" shows to repay fans for cancelled shows. In June 2010, the band self re-released their first album, Change of Plan via Bomber Music with added tracks from the "On The March" EP as Another Change Of Plan and in July the band will tour to promote the release. The cover was designed by Simon Mitchell, who has provided the artwork for t-shirts, posters, album and EP covers for many underground bands such as MikeTV. On 12 December 2010, the band played a triple headline show along with The Creepshow and The Skints. The Hydropaths and ACiD DROP also performed as part of the Slam Dunk punk/ska all dayer at The Cockpit (Leeds). The third album Seething Is Believing was released on Bomber Music in March 2011. In April 2012, the band announced that founding member and guitarist Matthew Crosher had been told to leave the band, with Dan Walsh confirmed as his replacement. ===Hit Reset and hiatus=== On 15 February, Random Hand announced on Facebook that they would be going on indefinite hiatus to allow them to spend time with their families. They ended this stage in their careers with a tour and PledgeMusic Campaign to release their final album Hit Reset, which was made available to download for donators on 13 September 2015. They ended their live career in spectacular fashion with their sell out final gig at the Camden Underworld supported by friends in Faintest Idea, River Jumpers and Sonic Boom Six, the latter whom provided a lot of support to Random Hand in their early days. In October 2017, after a two year break, Random Hand announced their return in 2018 with appearances at Mighty Sounds Festival in Prague and OutCider Festival and Manchester Punk Festival in the UK. ==Discography== ===Studio and Live albums and compilations=== {| class="wikitable" !Year !Title !Label !Notes |- |2007 |Change of Plan |Riot Music | |- |2009 |Inhale/Exhale |Rebel Alliance | |- |2010 |Another Change Of Plan |Bomber Music Our Records |Compilation of Change of Plan and On The March |- |2010 |Inhale/Exhale |Bomber Music Our Records | |- |- |2011 |Seething Is Believing |Bomber Music Our Records | |- |- |2013 |Live In K-Town |Bomber Music Our Records | |- |- |2015 |Hit Reset |Bomber Music Our Records | |- |} === EPs === {| class="wikitable" !Year !Title !Label |- |2003 |Buy This, Copy it and Give it To Your Friends (Demo No. 1) |self-released |- |2005 |On The March |self-released |- |} ===Singles=== {| class="wikitable" !Year !Title !Label |- |2009 |Anger Management |Rebel Alliance |- |2011 |Find What's Out There |Bomber Music |- |2011 |Bones |Bomber Music |- |} ==Members== ===Timeline=== ImageSize = width:900 height:auto barincrement:30 PlotArea = left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:10 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/2002 till:02/01/2019 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:1 ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:2002 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2002 Colors = id:vocals value:red legend:Vocals,_trombone id:bass value:blue legend:Bass,_vocals id:guitar value:green legend:Guitar,_vocals id:drums value:purple legend:Drums id:line1 value:black legend:Studio_albums id:line2 value:pink legend:Minor_releases LineData = layer:back color:line1 at:09/25/2007 at:01/25/2009 at:02/13/2010 at:03/04/2011 at:01/01/2015 color:line2 at:02/21/2003 at:08/04/2004 at:01/18/2013 BarData = bar:Robin text:"Robin Leitch" bar:Tiltson text:"Joe Tilston" bar:Matthew text:"Matthew Crosher" bar:Dan text:"Dan Walsh" bar:Joe text:"Joe Dimuantes" bar:Sean text:"Sean Howe" PlotData= width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Robin from:01/01/2002 till:end color:vocals bar:Tiltson from:01/01/2002 till:end color:bass bar:Matthew from:01/01/2002 till:03/10/2012 color:guitar bar:Dan from:04/20/2012 till:end color:guitar bar:Joe from:01/01/2002 till:05/27/2009 color:drums bar:Sean from:08/24/2009 till:end color:drums == References == Category:Underground punk scene in the United Kingdom Category:People from Keighley
