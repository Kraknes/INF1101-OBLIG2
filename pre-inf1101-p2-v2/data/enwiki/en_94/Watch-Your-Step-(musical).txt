Watch Your Step is a musical with music and lyrics by Irving Berlin and a book by Harry B. Smith. It was Irving Berlin's debut musical. "Play a Simple Melody" and "They Always Follow Me Around" as well as "When I Discovered You" and "The Syncopated Walk" were introduced by this musical. A highlight of the show was the Act II Finale, "Opera in Modern Time" in which melodies from famous operas were turned into popular dances of the time. The Ghost of Verdi then appeared to protest the ragging of his "Rigoletto" to no avail. "Watch Your Step" marked the first time a Tin Pan Alley composer moved "uptown" to Broadway with a complete score. ==Productions== The original Broadway production, produced by Charles Dillingham, opened at the New Amsterdam Theatre on December 8, 1914.
