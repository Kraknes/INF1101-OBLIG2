The HZ series 6111 is an electric multiple unit used by Croatian Railways (), formerly the class JZ 411 during the Yugoslav period. The vehicles were built by Ganz, Hungary. There were a few subseries of this class. A first class only (blue) series existed also at the time of the Sarajevo Winter Olympics. Today, only the white/blue coloured units exist, and are used for the Zagreb Commuter Rail and for some regional electrified railway lines in short to medium distance from Zagreb. ==External links== * * http://www.railfaneurope.net/ 6111
