Lakewood High School (commonly known as Lakewood or LHS) is a public secondary school in what was Arlington, but annexed to become an addition of Marysville, Washington, serving students in grades 9-12. The school is the only secondary school in the Lakewood School District, serving the Lake Goodwin, North Lakewood, and Smokey Point areas. The original high school was built in 1983 and expanded in later years to accommodate a growing school population. A $66.8 million bond measure was passed in April 2014 to design and build a new high school on the same campus, with a capacity of 825 students. Construction began in May 2016. The new two-story, building opened in September 2017 while demolition of the old building was still in progress. ==References== ==External links== *School website Lakewood High School Category:Lakewood School District (Washington) Category:Public high schools in Washington (state) Category:Arlington, Washington
