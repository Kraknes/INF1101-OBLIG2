16th century depiction of a court jester Roland the Farter (known in contemporary records as Roland le Fartere, Roulandus le Fartere or Roland le Petour) was a medieval flatulist who lived in twelfth-century England. He was given Hemingstone manor in Suffolk and of land in return for his services as a jester for King Henry II. Each year he was obliged to perform "Unum saltum et siffletum et unum bumbulum" (one jump, one whistle, and one fart) for the King's court at Christmas. Roland is listed in the thirteenth-century English Liber Feodorum (Book of Fees). ==See also== * Le Petomane ==References== * * * The Language of Farting by Evan R.
