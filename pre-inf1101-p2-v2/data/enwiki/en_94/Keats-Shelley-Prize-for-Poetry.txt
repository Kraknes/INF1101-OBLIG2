Distinguished judges of the Prize have included Andrew Motion, Claire Tomalin, Tom Paulin, Grevel Lindop, Miranda Seymour, the late Lord Gilmour, James Fenton, Stephen Fry, Jonathan Keates, A.N.Wilson, Ann Wroe, Janet Todd, Jack Mapanje, Dame Penelope Lively, Colin Thubron and Salley Vickers. {| class="wikitable" |- !
