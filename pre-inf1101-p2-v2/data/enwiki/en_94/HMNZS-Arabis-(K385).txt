She was commissioned in 1944 and decommissioned in 1948. After a refit, Arabis sailed for the Solomons, arriving at Renard Sound on 14 December 1944 where her captain took over as senior officer, 25th Minesweeper Flotilla, from Matai. She returned to Auckland on 20 June 1945. Two voyages to Noumea followed in July 1945 to escort with Tui the twelve RNZN Fairmiles back home to Auckland. ==Fate== Arabis was decommissioned in 1948, and broken up for scrap in 1951 ==See also== *Corvettes of the Royal New Zealand Navy ==References== *Walters, Sydney David (1956) The Royal New Zealand Navy: Official History of World War II, Department of Internal Affairs, Wellington Online *McDougall, R J (1989) New Zealand Naval Vessels.
