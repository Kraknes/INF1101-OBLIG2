Responses were mixed. Following the discussions of EAS Foreign Minister in Kuala Lumpur on 26 July 2006, to establish the agenda for the second EAS, it appeared that the proposal as it then stood did not have sufficient support to be included as an agenda item for the second EAS. Although the Philippines, which was the host for the second EAS, said trade would be on the agenda but in terms of the then present difficulties with the Doha Round. Nevertheless, even after the meeting of the EAS Foreign Ministers Japan appeared keen to continue to discuss the idea in terms of a Free Trade Agreement between the members of the EAS.http://www.tass.ru/eng/level2.html?NewsID=10673319&PageNum;=0http://www.bilaterals.org/article.php3?id_article=5909 India came out publicly in support of a pan-Asia Free Trade Agreement.Manmohan Singh sells his vision of pan-Asian FTA - Money - DNA New Zealand expressed its support.
