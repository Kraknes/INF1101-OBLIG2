Go Too (1977) is Go's third album. Go was founded by Stomu Yamashta, Steve Winwood and Michael Shrieve. For this album, Jess Roden replaced Steve Winwood (who had left the group). The style of the music became modified accordingly. In addition, Linda Lewis was hired as a singer. Together with Paul Jackson, Jr. and the orchestra of Martyn Ford the album unified various soundscapes. The album begins with the song Prelude, a synthesizer tune that is marked by Klaus Schulze's play. This is followed by Seen You Before, a jazz-funk-fusion piece of music with a remarkable solo by Al Di Meola. The next piece, Madness is a funk tune that crossfades at the end with the sound of waves onto the romantic song Mystery of Love. The tune is dominated by Al Di Meolas moving guitar solos and the emotional vocals of Roden and Lewis. Wheels of Fortune is characterized by complex rhythms and almost pure jazz, while Beauty again strikes a romantic note. The album ends with a funk-pointed piece, You and Me and Ecliptic, reminiscent of a synthesizer tune of whale songs. == Personnel == *Stomu Yamashta - synthesizers, piano, tympani, percussion *Klaus Schulze - synthesizers *J.
