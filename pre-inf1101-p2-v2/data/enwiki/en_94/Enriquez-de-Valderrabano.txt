Enriquez de Valderrabano (c. 1500 - after 1557) was a Spanish vihuelist and composer. There is little biographical data on this composer of early music, but his Libro de musica de vihuela intitulado Silva de Sirenas, published in Valladolid, Spain in 1547, states he is a citizen of Penaranda de Duero, and the book is dedicated to Francisco de Zuniga, the Fourth Count of Miranda. This dedication is probably the source of Juan Bermudo's unconfirmed assertion in his Declaracion de instrumentos musicales of 1555 that Valderrabano was employed by the count . Valderrabano's book of music has seven parts containing fugas, contrapuntos, sonetos, bajas, vacas, discantes, pavanas, proverbios, canciones, romances, and villancicos--ordered by level of difficulty. It includes pieces for two vihuelas, for vihuela and another instrument, and for vihuela and voice. Valderrabano's book is considered an important source of knowledge on the vihuela music of the Spanish Renaissance of the sixteenth century and European instrumental music in general, as it includes transcriptions of pieces by other significant composers of the time, including Cristobal de Morales, Josquin des Prez, Nicolas Gombert, Philippe Verdelot, Jorge Baez de Sepulveda, Adrian Willaert, Vincenzo Ruffo, Diego Ortiz, Juan Vasquez, and Jean Mouton. ==References== * ==External links== * Category:Renaissance composers Category:Spanish guitarists Category:Spanish male guitarists Category:Spanish classical composers Category:Spanish male classical composers Category:1500s births Category:16th-century deaths
