"Groove Me" is a song recorded by R&B; singer King Floyd. Released from his eponymous album in late 1970, it was a crossover hit, spending four non- consecutive weeks at number-one on Billboard Soul chart and peaking at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was recorded and produced by Wardell Quezergue at Malaco Records' Jackson, Mississippi recording studios during the same session as another Quezergue-produced song, Jean Knight's "Mr. Big Stuff". "Groove Me" was originally released as the B-side to Floyd's "What Our Love Needs" on the Malaco subsidiary Chimneyville. When New Orleans disc jockey George Vinnett started playing the B-side, the song began meriting attention, and as the record emerged as a local smash, Atlantic Records scooped up national distribution rights. ==Personnel== No credits are listed for the Malaco studio musicians on the record. According to Rob Bowman's liner notes from the 1999 box set, The Last Soul Company: Malaco, A Thirty Year Retrospective, the musicians for this session included: *Jimmy Honeycutt - saxophone *Bob Cheesman - trumpet *Wardell Quezergue - organ *Jerry Puckett - guitar *Vernie Robbins - bass *James Stroud - drums During this time at Malaco, horn lines were typically played by saxophonist Hugh Garraway and trumpeter Perry Lomax. ==Origin== According to Rob Bowman, Canadian professor of ethnomusicology, "Groove Me" had been inspired by a young college student who had worked about twenty feet away from Floyd at an east L.A. box factory. In Floyd's words: "She'd just watch me and smile at me all day. When I went to the water fountain, she would make it her purpose to come up to the water fountain. But, I was so shy. So, I decided one day that I was gonna write this poem and give it to her and I wrote 'Groove Me.' Believe it or not, after I finished it she never came back to work. It blew me away. So, I never gave her the poem. Man, I'd sure like to meet her one day just to thank her!" ==Cover versions== *The Blues Brothers covered the song in their hit 1978 album Briefcase Full of Blues, giving the song a Jamaican reggae feel. *In 1979, Fern Kinney, who sang backing vocals on King Floyd's original version, released a disco version of the song on her album Groove Me, which reached No. 6 on the Billboard dance chart. ==References== Category:1970 singles Category:Funk songs Category:Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs number-one singles Category:Etta James songs Category:1970 songs Category:Atlantic Records singles
