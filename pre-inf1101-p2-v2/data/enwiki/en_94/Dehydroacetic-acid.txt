Dehydroacetic acid is an organic compound which has several industrial applications. The compound is classified as a pyrone derivative. It presents as an odorless, colorless to white crystalline powder, almost insoluble in water and moderately soluble in most organic solvents. ==Preparation== It is prepared by the base-catalysed dimerization of diketene.Raimund Miller, Claudio Abaecherli, Adel Said, Barry Jackson. "Ketenes". In Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. 2001, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Commonly used organic bases include imidazole, DABCO, and pyridine. ==Uses== Industrially, dehydroacetic acid has several uses which include the following: * as a fungicide and bactericide. The sodium salt, sodium dehydroacetate, is often used in place of dehydroacetic acid because of its greater solubility in water. * as a food preservative to prevent pickle bloating in squash and strawberries.Harold William Rossmoore. Handbook of Biocide and Preservative Use, p. 341. When used as a food additive, dehydroacetic acid is referred to using the International Numbering System for Food Additives or E number 265. * as a plasticizer in synthetic resins. * as an antienzyme in toothpastes. * as a precursor for dimethyl-4-pyridones. The compounds are synthesized when dehydroacetic acid is exposed to aqueous solutions containing primary amines. ==References== Category:Fungicides Category:4-Pyrones
