Vietnamese cash ( ; chu Nom: ; ) is a cast round coin with a square hole that was an official currency of Vietnam from the Dinh dynasty in 970 until the Nguyen dynasty in 1945, and remained in circulation in North Vietnam until 1948. The same type of currency circulated in China, Japan, Korea, and Ryukyu for centuries. Though the majority of Vietnamese cash coins throughout history were copper coins, lead, iron (from 1528) and zinc (from 1740) coins also circulated alongside them often at fluctuating rates (with 1 copper cash being worth 10 zinc cash in 1882). The reason why coins made from metals of lower intrinsic value were introduced was because of various superstitions involving Vietnamese people burying cash coins, as the problem of people burying cash coins became too much for the government as almost all coins issued by government mints tended to be buried mere months after they had entered circulation, the Vietnamese government began issuing coins made from an alloy of zinc, lead, and tin. As these cash coins tended to be very fragile they would decompose faster if buried which caused the Vietnamese people to stop burying their coins.Manuel de Rivas, Idea del Imperio de Anam. Published: 1858 Manila, Spanish East Indies (in Castilian) == Currency units == Traditionally, the basic units of Vietnamese currency were quan (Guan , quan), tien, and dong. One quan was 10 tien, and one tien was between 50 and 100 dong, depending on the time period. From the reign of Emperor Tran Thai Tong onward, 1 tien was 69 dong in ordinary commercial transactions but 1 tien was 70 dong for official transactions. From the reign of Emperor Le Loi, 1 tien was decreed to be 50 dong. During the Southern and Northern Dynasties of Vietnam period, beginning in 1528, coins were reduced from to in diameter and diluted with zinc and iron. The smaller coinage was called tien gian or su tien, in contrast to the larger tien quy (literally, "valuable cash") or co tien. One quan tien quy was equivalent to 600 dong, while 1 quan tien gian was only 360 dong. During the Later Le Dynasty, 1 tien was 60 dong; therefore, 600 dong was 1 quan. During the Yuan Dynasty, Vietnamese traders at the border with China used the rate 1 tien to 67 dong. Zinc coins began to appear in Dai Viet during the 18th century. One copper (dong) coin was worth 3 zinc (kem) coins. Beginning with the reign of Emperor Gia Long, both copper and zinc coins were in use. Originally the two coins had equal value, but eventually a copper coin rose to double the worth of a zinc coin, then triple, then sixfold, until the reign of Emperor Thanh Thai, it was worth ten times a zinc coin. == History == Various Ly dynasty cash coins on display at the National Museum of Vietnamese History, Hanoi. === Dinh and Early Le dynasties === The first Vietnamese coins were cast under the rule of the Dinh Dynasty (968-981) with the introduction of the Thai Binh Hung Bao () under Dinh Bo Linh. Though for the next 2 centuries coins would remain a rarity in the daily lives of the common people as barter would remain the dominant means of exchange under both the Dinh and Early Le dynasties.Alotrip.com - We book, you travel.

This inspired Chinese traders to recast Chinese coins for export to Vietnam which caused an abundance of coinage to circulate in the country prompting the Ly government to suspend the mintage of coins for 5 decades. === Tran dynasty === The production of inferior coinage continued under the Tran dynasty. It was under the reign of Tran Du Tong that the most cash coins were cast of this period, this was because of several calamities such as failed crops that plagued the country during his reign that caused the Tran government to issue more coins to the populace as compensation. The internal political struggles of the Tran ensured the cessation of the production of coinage and as such no coins were produced during the entire reigns of the last 7 monarchs of the Tran dynasty. === Ho dynasty === man (Min ). During the Ho dynasty the usage of coins was banned by Ho Quy Ly in 1396 in favour of the Thong Bao Hoi Sao () banknote series and ordered people to exchange their coinage for these banknotes (with an exchange rate of 1 Quan of copper coins for 2 Thong Bao Hoi Sao banknotes),Linh, Vietnamese in Vancouver Thong bao hoi sao.

(in Japanese) === Later Le, Mac, and Revival Le dynasties === After Le Thai To came to power in 1428 by ousting out the Ming dynasty ending the Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam, Le Thai To enacted new policies to improve the quality of the manufacturing of coinage leading to the production of coins with both excellent craftsmanship and metal compositions that rivaled that of the best contemporary Chinese coinage.Luc Duc Thuan, Vo Quoc Ky, sach da dan (in Vietnamese) Between 1633 and 1637 the Dutch East India Company sold 105,835 strings of 960 cash coins (or 101,600,640 van) to the Nguyen lords in Vinh Lac Thong Bao (), and Khoan Vinh Thong Bao () coins. This was because the Japanese had restricted trade forcing the Southern Vietnamese traders to purchase its copper coins from the Dutch Republic rather than from Japanese merchants as had happened earlier. This trade lead to a surplus of copper in the territory of the Nguyen lords allowing them to use the metal (which at the time was scarce in the north) for more practical applications such as nails and door hinges.Viet Touch VIET NAM COINS & PAPER NOTES.

From the Duong Hoa era (1635-1643) under Le Than Tong until 1675 no coins were cast due to the political turmoil, at the turn of the 18th century Le Du Tong opened a lot of copper mines and renewed the production of high quality coinage. From 1719 the production of cast copper coins had ceased for 2 decades and taxes were more heavily lifted on the Chinese population as Mandarins could receive a promotion in rank for every 600 strings of cash (or 600,000 coins). Under Le Hien Tong a large variety of "Canh Hung" () coins were cast with varying descriptions on the obverse,Travel is easier with Linh Nha Hau Le (Le Trung Hung).

And there were new large Canh Hung coins with denominations of 50 and 100 van introduced. And from 1740 various provincial mint marks were added on the reverses of coins. Currently there are around 80 known different kinds of "Canh Hung" coins, the reason for this diversity is because the Le government was in dire need for coins to pay for its expenditures, while it needed to collect more taxes in coins so it began to mint a lot of coins, later to fulfill this need the Le legalised the previously detrimental workshops that were minting inferior coins in 1760 in order to meet the market's high demand for coinage, this backfired as the people found the huge variety in quality and quantity confusing.Alotrip.com - We book, you travel.

From 1837 under the reign of Minh Mang 1 Mach (Mo ) brass cash coins were issued, these cash coins feature Minh Mang Thong Bao (Ming Ming Tong Bao ) on their obverses but have 8 characters on their reverses. 1 Mach coins would be continued under subsequent rulers of the Nguyen dynasty. Copper-alloy and zinc cash coins issued under the reign of the Gia Long Emperor. "Tu Duc Thong Bao" () coins of varying denominations, on display at the Museum of Vietnamese History, Ho Chi Minh City. Since the reign of Gia Long zinc coins had replaced the usage of copper and brass coins and formed the basis of the Vietnamese currency system. Under Gia Long the standard 1 van denomination coins weighed 7 phan, under Minh Mang 6 phan (approximately 2,28 Grams) which would remain the standard for future rulers. Zinc cash coins produced in Hanoi under Tu Duc had the mint mark "Ha Noi" () on them, with there being another mint in Son Tay (). However, in 1871 the production of zinc cash coins stopped as many mines were being blocked by Chinese pirates, and the continued production of these coins would be too expensive. Other reasons for the discontinuation of zinc cash coins despite them being indispensable to the general populace was because they were heavy compared to its nominal value and the metal is quite brittle. To the French zinc coinage also presented a huge in inconvenience since their colonisation of Cochinchina in 1859 as the exchange between French francs and zinc van meant that a large amount of zinc coins were exchanged for the French franc. Zinc cash coins often broke during transportation as the strings that kept them together would often snap the coins would fall on the ground and a great number of them would break into pieces, and these coins were also less resistant to oxidation causing them to corrode faster than other coinages. Prior to 1849 brass coins had become an extreme rarity and only circulated in the provinces surrounding the capital cities of Vietnam, but under Tu Duc new regulations and (uniform) standards for copper cash coins were created to help promote their usage. Between 1868 and 1872 brass coins were only around 50% copper, and 50% zinc. Due to the natural scarcity of copper in Vietnam the country always lacked the resources to produce sufficient copper coinage for circulation. Under Tu Duc large coins with the denomination of 60 van were introduced, these coins were ordered to circulate at a value of 1 tien, but their intrinsic value was significantly lower so they were badly received and the production of these coins was quickly discontinued in favour of 20, 30, 40, and 50 van coins known as Dong Sao. In 1870 Tu Duc Bao Sao cash coins of 2, 3, 8, and 9 Mach were issued. Large denomination coins were mostly used for tax collection as their relatively low intrinsic value lowered their spending power on the market.H.A.

Though private mints were allowed to cast cash coins with the permission of the government, and a large number of cash coins were also imported from abroad as at that time the Portuguese colony of Macau had 6 mints with 12 furnaces producing 600,000 cash coins for Vietnam on a daily basis. Cash coins circulated in the 19th century along with silver and gold bars, as well as silver and gold coins known as tien. Denominations up to 10 tien were minted, with the 7 tien coins in gold and silver being similar in size and weight to the Spanish 8 real and 8 escudo pieces. These coins continued to be minted into the 20th century, albeit increasingly supplanted by French colonial coinage. ==== Under French rule ==== After the introduction of modern coinage by the French in 1878, cash coins remained in general circulation in French Cochinchina. Despite the later introduction of the French Indochinese piastre, zinc and copper-alloy cash coins would continue to circulate among the Vietnamese populace throughout the country as the primary form of coinage as the majority of the population lived in extreme poverty until 1945 (and 1948 in some areas) and were valued at the rates of about 500-600 cash coins for one piastre. The need for coins was only a minor part in the lives of most Vietnamese people at the time as barter remained more common as all coins were bartered on the market according to their current intrinsic values. Initially the French attempted to supplement cash coins in circulation by punching round holes into French 1 centime coins and shipping a large amount of them to French Cochinchina, but these coins did not see much circulation and the Cochinchinese people largely rejected them. On 7 April & 22 April 1879 the governor of French Cochinchina had decreed that the new designs for coins with "Cochinchine Francaise" on them would be accepted with the denominations 2 sapeques (cash coins), 1 cent, 10 cents, 20 cents, 50 cents, and the piastre. All coins except for the piastre was allowed to be issued, which allowed for Spanish dollars and Mexican reals to continue circulating. The Paris Mint produced the new machine-struck 2 sapeques "Cochinchine Francaise" cash coins. These French produced bronze cash coins weighed 2 grams were valued at piastre, they saw considerably more circulation than the previous French attempt at creating cash coins, but were still largely disliked by the Cochinchinese people. The local population still preferred their own Tu Duc Thong Bao (Si De Tong Bao ) cash coin despite it being only valued at piastre. Following the establishment of French Indochina, a new version of the French 2 sapeques was produced from 1887 to 1902 which was also valued at piastre and were likely forced on the Vietnamese people when they were paid for their goods and/or services by the French as the preference still was for indigenous cash coins. Under French administration the Nguyen government issued the Kien Phuc Thong Bao (Jian Fu Tong Bao ), Ham Nghi Thong Bao (Xian Yi Tong Bao ), Dong Khanh Thong Bao (Tong Qing Tong Bao ), Thanh Thai Thong Bao (Cheng Tai Tong Bao ), Duy Tan Thong Bao (Wei Xin Tong Bao ) cash coins of different metal compositions and weights. Each of these cash coins had their own value against the French Indochinese piastre. Because the exchange values between the native cash coins and silver piasters were confusing, the local Vietnamese people were often cheated by the money changers during this period. On 1 August 1898 it was reported in the Bulletin Economique De L'Indo-Chine article; Le Monnaie De L'Annam that the Hue Mint was closed in the year 1887, and in the year 1894, the casting of cash coins had started at the Thanh Hoa Mint. Between the years 1889 and 1890 the Hue Mint produced 1321 strings of 600 small brass Thanh Thai Thong Bao cash coins. These small brass cash coins were valued at 6 zinc cash coins. In the year 1893, large brass Thanh Thai Thong Bao cash coins with a denomination of 10 van (Shi Wen , thap van), or 10 zinc cash coins, started being produced by the Hue Mint. The production of Thanh Thai Thong Bao cash coins were resumed at the Thanh Hoa Mint between the years 1894 and 1899. Under Emperor Thanh Thai gold and silver coinages were also produced. In the year 1902 the French ceased production of machine-struck cash coins at the Paris Mint and completely deferred the production of cash coins back to the government of the Nguyen dynasty. There were people in Hanoi and Saigon that still preferred the French machine-struck cash coins, so a committee was set up in Hanoi that created a machine-struck zinc cash coin valued at piastre dated 1905 but issued in 1906. However, this series of cash coins wasn't well received by the either the local or the French population as the coins were brittle, prone to corrosion, and easily broke so their production was quickly halted. The last monarch whose name was cast on cash coins, Emperor Bao Dai, died in 1997. === Democratic Republic of Vietnam === After the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declared their independence in 1945 they began issuing their own money, but cash coins continued to circulate in the remote areas of Bac Bo and Trung Bo where there was a lack of xu, hao, and dong coins for the population. The Democratic Republic of Viet Nam Decree 51/SL of January 6, 1947 officially set the exchange rate at 20 Vietnamese cash coins for 1 North Vietnamese dong making them equal to 5 xu each. Vietnamese cash coins continued to officially circulate in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam until April 13, 1948. === Aftermath === During the Vietnam War a large number or Vietnamese numismatic charms with both authentic as well as fantasy coin inscriptions were produced in South Vietnam to be sold to foreigners interested in collecting Vietnamese antiques. These fantasy inscriptions included legends like Quang Trung Trong Bao (Guang Zhong Zhong Bao ), Ham Nghi Trong Bao (Xian Yi Zhong Bao ), and Khai Dinh Trong Bao (Qi Ding Zhong Bao ), the latter of which being based on the Khai Dinh Thong Bao (Qi Ding Tong Bao ). == List of Vietnamese cash coins == === Official and semi-official cash coins === Most Vietnamese cash coins tend to be read top-botton-right-left, but variants exist where the characters are read clockwise. The various cash coins of the Nguyen dynasty (1802-1945). During the almost 1000 years that Vietnamese copper cash coins were produced, they often significantly changed quality, alloy, size, and workmanship. In general, the coins bear the era name(s) of the monarch (Nien hieu/) but may also be inscribed with mint marks, denominations, miscellaneous characters, and decorations. Unlike Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Ryukyuan cash coins that always have the inscription in only one typeface, Vietnamese cash coins tend to be more idiosyncratic bearing sometimes Regular script, Seal script, and even Running script on the same coins for different characters, and it's not uncommon for one coin to be cast almost entirely in one typeface but has an odd character in another. Though early Vietnamese coins often bore the calligraphic style of the Chinese Khai Nguyen Thong Bao (Kai Yuan Tong Bao ) coin, especially those from the Dinh until the Tran dynasties.Asian Numismatic Museum (Sudoku One).

Coins were also often privately cast and these coins were sometimes of high quality or well-made imitations of imperial coinage, though often they would bear the same inscriptions as already circulating coinage, sometimes they would have "newly invented" inscriptions. The Nguyen lords that ruled over Southern Vietnam had also produced their own coinage at various times as they were the de facto kings of the South, but as their rule wasn't official, it is currently unknown what coins can be attributed to which Nguyen lord. Though since Edouard Toda has made his list in 1882 several of the coins that he had described as "originating from the Quang Nam province" have been ascribed to the Nguyen lords that the numismatists of his time couldn't identify. During the rule of the Nguyen lords many foundries for private mintage were also opened and many of these coins bear the same inscriptions as government cast coinage or even bear newly invented inscriptions making it hard to attribute these coins.Charms.ru Coincidences of Vietnam and China cash coins legends.

During the time that Vietnam was under French administration, the French started minting cash coins for circulation first for within the colony of Cochinchina and then for the other regions of Vietnam. These coins were minted in Paris and were all struck as opposed to the contemporary cast coinage that already circulated within Vietnam.Vietnam Banknotes V French Cochinchina coins.

(in French) After the French had annexed Cochinchina from the Vietnamese, cash coins would remain to circulate in the region and depending on their weight and metal (as Vietnamese cash coins made from copper, tin, and zinc circulated simultaneously at the time at fluctuating rates) were accepted at 600 to 1000 cash coins for a single Mexican or Spanish 8 real coin or 1 piastre. In 1870 the North German company Dietrich Uhlhorn started privately minting machine- struck Tu Duc Thong Bao (Si De Tong Bao ) coins as the demand for cash coins in French Cochinchina was high. The coin weighed 4 grams which was close to the official weight of 10 phan (3.7783 grams) which was the standard used by the imperial government at the time. Around 1875 the French introduced holed 1 cent coins styled after the Vietnamese cash. In 1879 the French introduced the Cochinchinese Sapeque with a nominal value of piastre, but the Vietnamese population at the time still preferred the old Tu Duc Thong Bao coins despite their lower nominal value. The weight and size of the French Indochinese 1 cent coin was reduced and the coin was holed in 1896 in order to appear more similar to cash coins, this was done to reflect the practice of stringing coins together and be carried on a belt or pole because Oriental garments at the time did not have pockets. The French production of machine-struck cash coins was halted in 1902. As there were people in Hanoi and Saigon that did not want to give up on the production of machine-struck cash coins, a committee decided to strike zinc Sapeque coins with a nominal value of piastre, these coins were produced at the Paris Mint and were dated 1905 despite being put into circulation only in 1906. These coins corroded and broke quite easily which made them unpopular and their production quickly ceased. After Khai Dinh became Emperor in 1916, Hanoi reduced the funds to cast Vietnamese cash coins which had a dissatisfying effect on the Vietnamese market as the demand for cash coins remained high, so another committee was formed in Hanoi that ordered the creation of machine-struck copper-alloy Khai Dinh Thong Bao (Qi Ding Tong Bao ) cash coins to be minted in Haiphong, these coins weighed more than the old French Sapeques and were around 2.50 grams and were accepted at piastre. There were 27 million Khai Dinh Thong Bao of the first variant produced, while the second variant of the machine-struck Khai Dinh Thong Bao had a mintage of 200 million, which was likely continued after the ascension of Emperor Bao Dai in 1926 which was normal as previous Vietnamese emperors also kept producing cash coins with the inscription of their predecessors for a period of time. Emperor Bao Dai had ordered the creation of cast Bao Dai Thong Bao (Bao Da Tong Bao ) cash coins again which weighed 3.2 gram in 1933, while the French simultaneously began minting machine-struck coins with the same inscription that weighed 1.36 grams and were probably valued at piastre. There were two variants of this cash coins where one had a large "Da " (Dai) while the other had a smaller "Da ".Howard A. Daniel III (The Journal of East Asian Numismatics - Second edition).

In modern Vietnam the supply of undiscovered cash coins is rapidly declining as large amounts of Vietnamese cash coins were excavated during the 1980s and 1990s, in Vietnam the excavation of antiques such as cash coins is an industry in itself and the cash coins are mostly being dug up by farmers. After the Vietnam War ended in 1975 a large number of metal detectors numbering in the many thousands were left behind in the former area of South Vietnam which helped fuel the rise of this industry. The antique bronze industry is mostly concentrated in small rural villages where farmers rent metal detectors to search their own lands for bronze antiques to then either sell as scrap or to dealers, these buyers purchase lumps of cash coins by either kilogramme or ton to then hire skilled people to search through these lumps of cash coins for sellable specimens, these coins are then sold to other dealers in Vietnam, China, and Japan. During the zenith of the coin recovery business in Vietnam the number of bulk coins found on a monthly basis was fifteen tons but only roughly fifteen kilogrammes of those coins were sellable and the rest of the coins would melted down as scrap metal. As better metal detectors that could search deeper more Vietnamese cash coins were discovered but in modern times the supply of previously undiscovered Vietnamese cash coins is quickly diminishing.Sudokuone (Vietnam's Imperial History as Seen Through its Currency) The Supply of Vietnamese Coins by Dr. R. Allan Barker. Retrieved: 03 April 2018. In modern times many Vietnamese cash coins are found in sunken shipwrecks which are mandated by Vietnamese law to be the property of the Vietnamese government as salvaged ships of which the owner was unknown belong to the state. Notable recent large finds of cash coins in Vietnam include 100 kilogrammes of Chinese cash coins and 35 kilogrammes of Vietnamese cash coins being unearthed in the province of Quang Tri in 2007, 52.9 kilogrammes of Chinese and Vietnamese cash coins being unearthed in a cemetery in Haiphong in 2008, 50 kilogrammes of cash coins in the province of Ha Nam in 2015, and some Nagasaki trade coins in the province of Ha Tinh in 2018. == See also == * Vietnamese dynasties * Cash * Chinese cash * Japanese mon * Korean mun * Ryukyuan mon == Notes == == References == == Sources == * ED.
