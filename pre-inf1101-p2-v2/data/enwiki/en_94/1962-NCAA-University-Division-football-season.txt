The 1962 NCAA University Division football season was played by American football teams representing 140 colleges and universities recognized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as major programs. The remaining 370 colleges and universities that were NCAA members and fielded football teams competed in the 1962 NCAA College Division football season. During the 20th century, the NCAA had no playoff for the major college football teams in the University Division, later known as Division I-A. The NCAA did recognize a national champion based upon the final results of "wire service" (AP and UPI) polls. The extent of that recognition came in the form of acknowledgment in the annual 'NCAA Football Guide of the "unofficial" national champions. The AP poll in 1962 consisted of the votes of 52 sportswriters, each of whom would give their opinion of the ten best teams. Under a point system of 10 points for first place, 9 for second, etc., the "overall" ranking was determined. Although the rankings were based on the collective opinion of the representative sportswriters, the teams that remained "unbeaten and untied" were generally ranked higher than those that had not. A defeat, even against a strong opponent, tended to cause a team to drop in the rankings, and a team with two or more defeats was unlikely to remain in the Top 10. The top teams played on New Year's Day in the four major postseason bowl games: the Rose (near Los Angeles at Pasadena), Sugar (New Orleans), Orange (Miami) and Cotton (Dallas). ==Rule changes== * Reduced the penalty for illegal shift from 15 to five yards. * Allows punts downed inside the 10 yard line to be spotted where the punt is downed. Previously these punts were returned to the 20 yard line (touchback). * Increased to 15 yards the penalty for the defense kicking a forward pass or a placekick held by an opponent. ==Conference and program changes== ===Conference changes=== *Four conferences began play in 1962: **College Athletic Conference - an active NCAA Division III conference that ended sponsorship of football after the 2017 season; known as the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference after the 1991 season **Gateway Conference - active through the 1974 season **Western Athletic Conference - began play with former members of the Border Conference (Arizona and Arizona State) and the Skyline Conference (BYU, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming). The remaining members of the Border (Hardin-Simmons, New Mexico State, Texas Western, and West Texas State) and the Skyline (Colorado State, Montana, and Utah State) became independents. The only exception was Denver, who dropped its football program entirely. *One conference upgraded to the NCAA University Division in 1962: ** Mid-American Conference - moved up from the College Division to the University Division beginning in 1962. The conference had been considered among the best in the college division. The previous year two MAC schools, Western Michigan and Bowling Green, were invited to bowl games. The conference produced college division national champions Ohio in 1960 and Bowling Green in 1959. In addition, Miami of Ohio finished second in the final 1958 College Division poll and was ranked in the final major AP and UPI polls in 1955. ===Membership changes=== {| class="wikitable sortable" |- !
