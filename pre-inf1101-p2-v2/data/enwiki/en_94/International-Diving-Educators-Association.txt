The International Diving Educators Association or (IDEA) was founded in 1952 as the Florida Skin Divers Association (FSDA) Scuba Training Committee, and later changed its name to the Florida Scuba Divers Association. Then, in February 1976 the FSDA Scuba Training Committee members voted to create the International Diving Educators Association, based on the principles of the FSDA to make the organization an international Scuba diving certification agency.
