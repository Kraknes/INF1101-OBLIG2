Gladys is a female name from the Welsh name Gwladus or Gwladys, which bears the meaning of royalty (princess); conversely, it has been speculated to originally be from the Latin diminutive "gladiolus," meaning small sword hence the gladiolus flowering plant. It may be used as a Welsh variant of Claudia, meaning lame. == People == *Gladys Adda (1921-1995), Tunisian communist and activist *Gladys Aller, American painter *Gladys Ambrose, English actress *Gladys Anderson, New Zealand artist *Gladys Anoma (1930-2006), Ivorian scientist and politician *Gladys Anslow, American physicist *Gladys Arnold *Gladys Asmah, Ghanaian politician *Gladys Aylward (1902-1970), English missionary to China *Gladys Elizabeth Baker, American mycologist *Gladys Baldwin (1937-1982), Peruvian sports shooter *Gladys E.
