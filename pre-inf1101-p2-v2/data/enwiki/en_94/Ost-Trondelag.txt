The Norwegian Kingdom at its greatest extent, c. 1265 Ost-Trondelag (, Norwegian name; or Ost-Trondelag, ; ) is an unofficial and polemic name for the Swedish regions Jamtland and Harjedalen which until 1645 belonged to Norway. As the name suggests, the region lies to the east of the Norwegian region of Trondelag. The toponym is a neologism with no historic merit, since all of historic Trondelag was returned to Norway in 1660 following a brief occupation by Sweden -- unlike Bohuslan, Idre & Serna (formerly part of Osterdalen), Herjedalen and Jemtland, all of which were annexed and have been part of Sweden for centuries. In the 1940s, during the German occupation of Norway, some Norwegian politicians called for the annexation of Ost-Trondelag to provide the collaborationist Quisling regime new opportunities for expansion.Foreign Policy Bulletin.

In 2004, Norwegian students humorously erected road signs on the border indicating that travelers were entering the Norwegian county of Ost-Trondelag.Article in Adressa == References == Category:Jamtland Category:Harjedalen Category:Geography of Jamtland County Category:Norway-Sweden border Category:Trondelag
