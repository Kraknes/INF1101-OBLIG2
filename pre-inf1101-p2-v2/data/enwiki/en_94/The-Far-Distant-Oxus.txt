The Far-Distant Oxus is a 1937 British children's novel by Katharine Hull (1921-1977) and Pamela Whitlock (1920-1982), written while they were still children themselves.Carpenter and Prichard, 182.Carpenter and Prichard, p. 569. The title is taken from Matthew Arnold's poem Sohrab and Rustum, and the characters in the story choose names from it for the places around them in the north coast of Devon; the real Oxus is a river in Central Asia. ==Ponies and Exmoor== Hull and Whitlock met when they were pupils (of 14 and 15 respectively) at St Mary's School, Ascot, whilst sheltering from a thunderstorm. They discovered shared interests and decided to write a story about ponies set on Exmoor. They planned out the entire book and wrote alternate chapters, exchanging them afterwards for editing.Bearne and Watson. ==Ransome and Cape== The story follows the model of the books of Arthur Ransome, describing the school holiday adventures of children of active, adventurous families, centred on outdoor activity and a vivid landscape soaked in imagination. Ransome had boats and Windermere, The Far-Distant Oxus ponies and the moors. Whitlock sent the manuscript to Ransome in March 1937; he in turn brought it to his publisher Jonathan Cape, saying that he had "the best children's book of 1937" for him.Brogan, p. 353. Cape published the book in the Swallows and Amazons format and persuaded Ransome to write an introduction. ==Success== The book, illustrated by Whitlock, was successful; contemporary reviewers were impressed and critics today remain positive. The Cambridge Guide to Children's Books comments that it is "as absorbing as Ransome at his best".Watson, p. 1121 The two authors followed it with Escape to Persia (1938), The Oxus in Summer (1939) and Crowns (1947). Fidra Books reissued the novel in August 2008. ==See also== *List of books written by children or teenagers ==Further reading== *Eve Bearne and Victor Watson: Where Texts and Children Meet, London: Routledge, 1999, p. 56 *Hugh Brogan: The Life of Arthur Ransome, London: Jonathan Cape, 1984 *Humphrey Carpenter and Mari Prichard:The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature, Oxford: OUP, 1984 *Victor Watson: The Cambridge Guide to Children's Books in English, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2001 ==References== Category:1937 British novels Category:20th-century British children's literature Category:British children's novels Category:Novels set in Devon Category:Jonathan Cape books Category:Pony books Category:1937 children's books
