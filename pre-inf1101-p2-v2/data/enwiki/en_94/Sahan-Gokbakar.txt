Sahan Gokbakar (born 22 October 1980) is a Turkish comedian and film actor. ==Early career== Gokbakar grew up in Turkey's capital, Ankara, attending the primary school and high school attached to the Middle East Technical University (ODTU). After completing high school in 1997, he went on to study Theatre at Bilkent University's Faculty of Music and Performing Arts in Ankara. ==Portrayal of Recep Ivedik== Recep Ivedik, the eponymous protagonist of the popular film series, had according to Hurriyet Daily News reviewer Emrah Guler, enjoyed some moderate fame as the anti-hero in comedian Sahan Gokbakar's sketch shows, generating a modest fan group on YouTube. Gokbakar teamed up with his younger brother Togan Gokbakar, who first made his name as a director with some short films and had always showed an interest in working with his older brother, to turn the character into a cash cow with a series of films, which proved to be the highest grossing movies in the respective years of their release and at the same time the most loathed films to come to screens in the minds of critics and intellectuals. We are uneasy that our district is being mentioned by a character like Ivedik, proclaimed Abdullah Yilmaz, president of the Youth Council for Gungoren District, the district of Istanbul where Recep Ivedik is portrayed as residing, Gungoren is a district where educated and intellectual people live. It is not right to associate Gungoren with an impolite character who does not know any manners, he continued before stating that the council would take action to prevent the district from being mentioned in future films in the series. == Filmography == === Cinema movies === {| class="wikitable sortable" |- !
