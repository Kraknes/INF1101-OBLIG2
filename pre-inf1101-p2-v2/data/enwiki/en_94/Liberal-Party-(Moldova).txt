Mihai Ghimpu was elected president of the party. The party competed in the April 2009 parliamentary election, obtaining 13.13% of the vote and of 15 seats in parliament. At the parliamentary election of 2009 in July, the popular vote rose to 14.68%, again winning 15 seats.

The party was included in the First Filat Cabinet. At the 2010 parliamentary election, the party obtained 9.96% of the vote and 12 seats in parliament. The party remained in the Second Filat Cabinet. The European Action Movement (MAE) merged into the party in March, 2011. Under the leadership of Ghimpu, the party has altered its former Christian democratic orientation. On 25 January 2009, a Conference for the constitution of a Women's wing for the Liberal Party the "Liberal Women's Organisation" was held. The party also formed a youth wing the "Young Liberals". The party has joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) as an observer member. At the 2014 parliamentary election, the Liberal Party received 9.7% of the vote, winning 13 seats. At the 2019 parliamentary election, the PL received 1.25% of the vote, losing its representation in parliament. === Internal split === In February 2013 the party suffered an internal split. On 12 April 2013 the Liberal Party Reform Council was launched, with Ion Hadarca as leader. The members of this Council were called "Liberal Reformers" by the media. The internal split became permanent when a separate Liberal Reformist Party (PLR) joined the Pro-European Coalition, formed after the dissolution of the Alliance for European Integration, remaining on in the Leanca Cabinet after the Liberal Party left the government. ==Electoral results== ===Parliament=== {| class="wikitable" |- !
