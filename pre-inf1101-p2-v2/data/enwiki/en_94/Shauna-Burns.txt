Photo taken by Peggy Fernandez of Shauna Burns, 2017 == Early life == Shauna Burns' mother (originally from Utah) and father (from Nevada) settled in Miami, Florida. Shauna Burns began on her musical path as a child watching and imitating her mother play the piano. Eventually her mother began teaching her chords, playing technique, and songs (often Broadway musical tunes). She began to find her own artistic identity in her pre-teen years, along with a widening of her musical interests. Shauna began composing around the age of 12 and started to take music more seriously. After watching a Depeche Mode performance, Shauna had an epiphany that she too would have a career as a performer. Her vision was strengthened by the success of other female artists such as Tori Amos, Sinead O'Connor, and Sarah McLachlan. == First Stage Performance == While studying anthropology at the University of Utah, Shauna Burns played in public for the first time at a local coffeehouse, after the nudging of some of her friends. Nervous and reluctant at first, Shauna was enheartened by the warm and supportive response to her and her music by the audience. She loved the experience, and the intimacy of playing directly for people left an impression on her. Shauna began to perform on a regular basis at local coffeehouses as well as other venues. == Debut Recording - Every Thought == After graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Anthropology from the University of Utah, Shauna Burns spent a year (from 2003 to 2004) in Europe during which time she began preparing her debut album. Released in 2005 by Red Rock Music, Every Thought was received with critical acclaim. She embarked on a vigorous tour of the United States that same year in support of the album and developed a loyal following. Sometimes compared to Dave Matthews and Tori Amos, Shauna Burns has a sound all her own. Her ethereal vocals and piano are recorded live with the band (Shauna on piano and vocals, James Clark on drums and percussion, Ryan Tilby on bass and guitar, Steve Lemmon on guitar, Caroline Kemper on Celtic Harp and Rick Kemper on Irish Whistle) with some post-production vocals and musical fills added, resulting in an other-worldly listening experience. == Public Reception == Every Thought was selected as one of the Top CDs of 2005 by Collected Sounds and the single, "Pink Girl," was chosen as the #1 Indie single from the MAACP show and the album was chosen as "Best of the Batch" from the Music Industry News Network, and was featured on TowerPod, Indie-Music, Billboard, VH1, Artist Direct, AOL Music, and Fox TV. == Desert Tune == Every Thought was followed by the 2006 release entitled Desert Tune. This 5 song EP, which is an extension of Every Thought, has Shauna on vocals and piano, James Clark co-producing and on drums and percussions, Steve Lemmon on guitar, and Ryan Tilby on guitar and bass. == The Moon and the Fire Circle == The Moon and the Fire Circle was released on 19 February 2008 with a record release show held at The Mint in Los Angeles on the same day. "Around You" (the first single) was one of WCH Radio's "Top Songs for 2008" and reached number 1 on "Song Vault Radio". The Moon and the Fire Circle was selected "Best of 2008" by Collected Sounds and The Promise Live. Radio Crystal Blue also chose Shauna as one of the "Top Recording Artists of the Year 2008". Musicians on The Moon and the Fire Circle: Shauna on piano and vocals, James Clark on drums and percussion, Steve Lemmon on guitar, bass and programming, Ryan Tilby on guitar, mandolin, bass and upright bass, Caroline Kemper on Celtic Harp, John Minor on cello and Paul Barfuss on guitar. == Radio Success == "Around You", the first single from The Moon and the Fire Circle, hit number 7 on the FMQB AC (Adult Contemporary) Chart in April 2008. It debuted at number 38 and peaked at number 7. == Anamnesis == The continuation of The Moon and the Fire Circle is the follow-up EP Anamnesis, released on 14 April 2009. Anamnesis, which means "recollection" or "remembrance", focuses on the senses that live in memories. Musicians on Anamnesis: Shauna on piano, rhodes and vocals, James Clark on drums and percussion, Steve Lemmon on guitars, bass and programming, Ryan Tilby on mandolin and dobro, Kiley Astle on violin and Steve Nelson on cello. == Touring == Shauna Burns toured the United States and Europe in 2006 and 2007 in support of Every Thought and Desert Tune with over 55 shows and appearances. The Moon and the Fire Circle tour kicked off on 6 March 2008 in Portland, Oregon, with over 25 shows and appearances throughout the year mostly with her band: Shauna Burns on piano and vocals, James Clark on drums, Steve Lemmon on guitar, Marc Kolodziej on bass and Ryan Tilby on guitar and mandolin. Shauna Burns hit the road again with her Wandering Planets Tour that started in Flagstaff, Arizona on 24 April 2009. == A Winter Gathering == A Winter Gathering was released on 25 Oktober 2011. Burns describes her latest musical venture, the Celtic flavored A Winter Gathering, as a new journey for her--a collection of newfangled carols and original songs performed by her with her husband, drummer James Clark. Bringing unique new elements and sounds to her trademark style, Burns offers new twists to classic songs like "Carol of the Bells," "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen" and "Silent Night" and includes three short original "breath point" pieces she calls "Songscapes." == Violet == After 2011's "A Winter Gathering," Burns feels Violet is "A new seed planted. Almost ready to bloom forth!" The direction taken for this project is focused on women and female empowerment and continues in the tone of her Celtic flare. "Violet," follows the same structure from A Winter Gathering by having collaborations on the album performed by Burns and her husband, drummer/percussionist James Clark (who also co-produced Violet along with her previous releases), as well as Ryan Whyte Maloney on the guitar, Lindsey Springer on the cello, and Caroline Kemper on harp. Violet contains 14 songs. With new songs titled "Orchid" and "Portobello", Burns has stated that this album will have a positive, uplifting spirit. Her first single, "Little Song," from the album, is already receiving airplay from several radio stations worldwide. == Hazel, Gray Moon, From Flying == In 2015 Shauna Burns celebrated the 10 Year Anniversary of her debut album Every Thought, commemorating the music that weaves and accentuates empowering themes. In light of the anniversary, Shauna released three rousing singles: "Hazel", "Gray Moon", and "From Flying". These singles were picked from the achieves of recordings done throughout the previous 10 years. Shauna's soothing voice glides across her signature sweeping keyboard style and a driving drum rhythm in her first 2015 single, "Hazel." The second single, "Gray Moon" is a soothing song where she sings of change and the goodness that comes with it. The lyrics are paired with beautifully orchestrated piano solos bringing it all together for a minimal, dramatic effect that highlights Burns' recognizable vocals and inspirational lyrics. "From Flying," Shauna's third single in 2015, was inspired by taking risks and following dreams. "'From Flying' seems like it covers a lot of space and time to me. The song is about jumping off the cliff of possibility even when it seems like it's impossible. Going for your dreams against the odds." == Scarborough Fair == The singer-songwriter and pianist released her cover single of an old-time classic "Scarborough Fair," on October 6, 2017, through the label Red Rock Music. Shauna Burns rejuvenates "Scarborough Fair" with her own Celtic spin to this English traditional ballad. Singing the female's reply to the male's request to prove true love, Shauna brings her own perspective to this classic tale. Her intricate yet, delicate piano melodies whisk through the entire piece. Shauna's crystalline and haunting vocal performance is laced between engaging threads and a Celtic harp that broaden the dreamy effect of the song. "Scarborough Fair" was produced by Shauna Burns and James Clark, and co-produced by Dee Kei Waddell. Shauna and her piano were joined by Caroline Kemper ReidReynoso on Celtic Harp, Dee Kei Waddell on double bass and keyboards, and photography by Peggy Fernandez. == Discography == *Every Thought (2005) *Desert Tune (2006) *The Moon and the Fire Circle (2008) *Anamnesis (2009) *A Winter Gathering (2011) *Violet (2013) *Hazel -single (2015) *Gray Moon -single (2015) *From Flying -single (2015) *Scarborough Fair -single (2017) == References == *1. http://www.shaunaburns.com/ *2. http://www.redrockmusiclabel.com/ *3. http://www.rockwired.com/rockwired_interviews_shauna_burns.html *4. http://www.ubl.com/artists/shaunaburns/ *5. https://archive.org/details/TowerpodArtistProfile_ShaunaBurns *6. https://web.archive.org/web/20090130121626/http://www.wchradio.net/top50songsfor2008.htm *7. http://www.songvault.fm/artists.htm?id=1898 *8. http://www.blog.collectedsounds.com/?cat=30 *9 https://web.archive.org/web/20090521120944/http://www.radiocrystalblue.com/chart.html ==External links== Category:1981 births Category:American alternative rock musicians Category:American female singer-songwriters Category:American pop pianists Category:American women pianists Category:American female pop singers Category:American pop singers Category:American rock pianists Category:American rock singers Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American rock songwriters Category:Female rock singers Category:Feminist musicians Category:Living people Category:21st-century American women singers Category:21st-century American singers Category:21st- century American pianists
