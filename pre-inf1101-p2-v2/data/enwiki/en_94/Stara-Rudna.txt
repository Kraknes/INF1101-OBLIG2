Stara Rudna () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Rudna, within Lubin County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland. Prior to 1945 it was in Germany. It lies approximately north-east of Lubin, and north-west of the regional capital Wroclaw. The village has a population of 140. The place, originally called Ruda, may have developed out of an old Slavic castle and a church built in approximately 1100 by Piotr Wlostowic of Dunin, though no documents are saved. Christian Knorr von Rosenroth, a Christian Hebraist, was born in Alt Raudten in 1631. ==References== Stara Rudna
