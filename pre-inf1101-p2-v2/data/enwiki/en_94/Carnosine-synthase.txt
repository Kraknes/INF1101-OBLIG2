Carnosine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :ATP + L-histidine + beta-alanine \rightleftharpoons ADP + phosphate + carnosine The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, L-histidine, and beta-alanine, whereas its 3 products are ADP (previously thought to form AMPhttp://enzyme.expasy.org/EC/6.3.2.11), diphosphate, and carnosine. This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon- nitrogen bonds as acid-D-amino-acid ligases (peptide synthases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is 'L-histidine:beta-alanine ligase (AMP- forming)' (incorrect on AMP- forminghttp://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/EC6/3/2/11.html). Other names in common use include 'carnosine synthetase', 'carnosine-anserine synthetase', 'homocarnosine synthetase', and 'carnosine-homocarnosine synthetase'. ==Gene== The gene encoding this enzyme has been identified by Jakub Drozak an coworkers in 2010. The gene encoding the Carnosine synthase is ATPGD1, a member of the "ATP-grasp family" of ligases. Because of its involvement in the formation of carnosine, this gene is now also named 'CARNS1'. ==References== * * Category:EC 6.3.2 Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
