John Peter Bell is a former Canadian diplomat. He was concurrently appointed as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Mali and Niger then to Upper Volta and to the Ivory Coast. He later became Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Brazil then the High Commissioner to Malaysia. ==Macau casino money laundering== While serving as Canada's chief federal negotiator for B.C. First Nations land claims, Bell made an investment in a Macau casino VIP room that was leased from Stanley Ho. Ho has been linked to the Kung Lok Triad (Chinese mafia) and as being linked to "several illegal activities" during the period 1999-2002. Ho's alleged ties to Chinese organized crime have also been reported by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, citing a U.S. Senate committee and several government agencies, when the state investigated his ties to American casino operator MGM Mirage. Bell stated he loaned US$250,000 to his cousin David Stuart Levy, who denies the loan. Levy hand delivered up to $150,000 US to Bell between 2000 and 2004. The amount in each delivery varied based on casino earnings. Their relationship deteriorated and "in September 2005, Bell went to Levy's home in West Vancouver, and emerged with a signed agreement from Levy for repayment of 'US$250,000 invested in Macau.'" == External links == * Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada Complete List of Posts *B.C. court throws curveball on spousal support == Notes == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Ambassadors of Canada to Mali Category:Ambassadors of Canada to Niger Category:Ambassadors of Canada to Burkina Faso Category:Ambassadors of Canada to Ivory Coast Category:Ambassadors of Canada to Brazil Category:High Commissioners of Canada to Malaysia
