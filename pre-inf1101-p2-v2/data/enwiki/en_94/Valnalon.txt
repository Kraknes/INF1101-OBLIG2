Ciudad Tecnologica Valnalon VALNALON (Ciudad Industrial del Valle del Nalon, S.A.U.)http://www.valnalon.com/ was created by the Department for Industry and Labour of the Government of the Principality of Asturias, Spain in 1987. The goal is to design and implement a plan to regenerate, promote and dynamise a former industrial area in Nalon River Valley. In order to achieve this, some of the most outstanding century-old buildings in the Felguera Factory, steelworks factory compound, whose gates closed in 1984, were refurbished. ==Aims== The plan has evolved, tilting the focus from the development of infrastructures (Business centre, industrial estate, training centre) to a firm commitment to develop entrepreneurship in order to change mindsets, facilitating the transition from the industrial age to a more entrepreneurial society. ===Technological city=== The concept Industrial City has morphed into Technological City mainly driven by the creation and development of start-ups in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector. ===Action plan=== In 1993 Valnalon was commissioned by Asturias regional government to implement the recently launched Asturias Entrepreneurship Action Plan (Cadena de Formacion para Emprender) with two priority areas: ;Education Entrepreneurship education, whose goal is to develop enterprising skills and attitudes in all levels of the education system. ;Promotion Business promotion, whose goal is to support business development. ==Stakeholders== In this sense, Valnalon seeks to engage a wide array of stakeholders as all of them should be involved and contribute to the development of an entrepreneurial culture. ==References== Category:Economic history of Spain Category:Asturias Category:Urban renewal
