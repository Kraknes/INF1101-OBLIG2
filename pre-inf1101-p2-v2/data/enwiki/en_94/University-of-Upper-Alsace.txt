University of Upper Alsace (, UHA) is a multidisciplinary teaching and research centre based in the two cities of Mulhouse and Colmar, France. Research and teaching at UHA concentrates mainly on science, technology, economics, management, arts and humanities. In 2017, UHA has more than 8000 students with about a hundred courses offered. The founding of UHA was driven by social and business players, among them was Jean-Baptiste Donnet. The special geographical situation of UHA, which lies close to the Swiss and German borders, is favourable to the emergence of single courses leading to double or triple degrees that are recognized in the neighbouring countries. Together with Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg, University of Basel, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, as well as Strasbourg University, the university of Upper Alsace is a member of the EUCOR, which is a trinational cross-border alliance of five universities on the Upper Rhine in the border region between Germany, France and Switzerland. ==History== ==Departments== The university consists of Unites de Formation -- Universite de Mulhouse Colmar Alsace -- DUT, Licences, Licences professionnelles, Masters, Doctorats et Diplomes d'ecoles d'ingenieurs five faculties: *FLSH - Faculte des Lettres, Langues et Sciences Humaines *FSESJ - Faculte des Sciences Economiques, Sociales et Juridiques *FST - Faculte des Sciences et Techniques *PEPS - Pluridisciplinaire d'Enseignement Professionnalise Superieur *FMA - Faculte de Marketing et Agrosciences two institutes of technology: IUT de Mulhouse * IUT DE COLMAR - Institut Universitaire de Technologie de Colmar * IUT DE MULHOUSE - Institut Universitaire de Technologie de Mulhouse and two schools of engineering: *ENSCMu - Ecole Nationale Superieure de Chimie de Mulhouse *ENSISA - Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Ingenieurs Sud Alsace (Fusion in 2006 between ENSITM and ESSAIM) ==References== Category:Educational institutions established in 1975 Category:Universities in Grand Est Category:Education in Mulhouse Category:Buildings and structures in Mulhouse Category:Education in Colmar Category:Buildings and structures in Colmar
