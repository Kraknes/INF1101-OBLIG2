The sohaegeum (hangul: sohaegeum; hanja: Si Xi Qin ) is a North Korean musical instrument, developed in the 1960s. It is essentially a modernized form of the haegeum (a traditional Korean bowed vertical fiddle). So (hanja: Si ) in sohaeheum means "four," because it has four strings. Its tuning pegs are like those of the violin, inserted from the side, compared to those of the haegeum, which are inserted from the front. The bow used is not used in between the strings but is played from the front like the violin also. ==External links== *Sohaegum photo *Sohaegum photo ==See also== *Haegum *Traditional Korean musical instruments *Huqin Category:Korean musical instruments Category:Bowed instruments
