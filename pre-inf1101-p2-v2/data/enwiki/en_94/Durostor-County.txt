Durostor County was a county (judet) of the Kingdom of Romania, in Southern Dobruja, with the seat at Silistra. The county was located in the south- eastern part of Greater Romania, in the southern Dobrogea region, known as Cadrilater. Currently the territory of the former county is split between Bulgaria and Romania; in Bulgaria, the former county's territory belongs to Silistra Province, the eastern part of the former county remained within territory of Romania constituting the territory around Ostrov in today's Constanta County. The county consisted of 4 districts (plasi): Accadanlar, Curtbunar, Silistra and Turtucaia. The county was neighbored by the counties of Ilfov and Ialomita to the north, Caliacra and Constanta to the east and the Kingdom of Bulgaria to the south. ==History== As a result of Romania's involvement in the Second Balkan War, the part of the Cadrilater north of the Turtucaia - Balcic line was annexed by Romania in 1913, despite criticism on the a part of the political opposition (e.g. the socialist Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, who appreciated that this act would create for Romania a new and fierce enemy over a 600 km frontier on its southern flank, in Bulgaria which had, until then, been a friendly country whose independence had been obtained simultaneously with Romania's.Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea - ,,Opere Complete" (Ed. Politica, 1976-1983, citat in Catherine Durandin: ,,Istoria Romanilor", trad : L. Buruiana-Popovici, Ed. Institutului European, Bucuresti, 1998) After the annexation of the Cadrilater to Romania, Durostor County, headquartered in Silistra, was established in the same year. Bulgaria managed to regain it between 1916 and 1918, but then lost it again after the end of World War I (see Treaty of Neuilly). Durostor County, together with the rest of the Cadrilater, remained with Romania until 1940, when Treaty of Craiova of September 7 returned to Bulgaria as an indirect consequence of Nazi German political pressure on the Romanian government. ==Etymology== The county was named after the Roman name of Silistra, Durostorum. ==Coat of arms== The Coat of Arms depicted Mircea the Elder. ==Population== According to the Romanian census of 1930 the population of Durostor County was 211,433, of which 42.8% were ethnic Turks, 34.2% ethnic Bulgarians, 19.0% ethnic Romanians, 1.4% Romanies, as well as other minorities.Recensamantul general al populatiei Romaniei din 29 decemvrie 1930, Vol. II, pag. 186-187 Classified by religion: 54.0% Orthodox Christian, 45.1% Islam, as well as other minorities.Recensamantul general al populatiei Romaniei din 29 decemvrie 1930, Vol. II, pag. 614 By 1937, the population was estimated to have risen to 230,309. ==Administrative organization== Map of Durostor County as constituted in 1938. The county's capital was the town of Silistra (sometimes referred to by an antiquated Romanian name, Darstor). Other urban centres were the towns of Ostrov and Turtucaia.
