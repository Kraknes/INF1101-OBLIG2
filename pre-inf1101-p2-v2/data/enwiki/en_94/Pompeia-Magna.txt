In 59 BC, her father Pompey married for a fourth time, to Julia Caesaris, the daughter of Julius Caesar. After their marriage, Pompeia was betrothed to a Servilius Caepio, but she instead married Faustus Cornelius Sulla, a politician who was the son of Roman dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla from his wife Caecilia Metella. Around 47 BC, Faustus died in the African War against Julius Caesar. Their two sons fell into the hands of Julius Caesar, however Caesar dismissed them as a danger and pardoned them. After 46 BC, Pompeia married for a second time to politician Lucius Cornelius Cinna, who was brother of Julius Caesar's first wife Cornelia, and thus the maternal uncle of Julia, Pompeia's step- mother. For a time Pompeia accompanied her younger brother Sextus Pompey to Sicily. It was in Sicily that Pompeia made various presents for the young future emperor, Tiberius, who had fled with his parents there from Octavian. Pompeia gave Tiberius such presents as a cloak, a brooch, and a gold bulla. The historian Suetonius states that these presents were preserved and were exhibited in Baiae in his time. Sextus Pompey survived Pompeia when she died, sometime before 35 BC. ==Children== * First marriage to Faustus Cornelius Sulla, a politician who was the son of Roman dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla from his wife Caecilia Metella.
