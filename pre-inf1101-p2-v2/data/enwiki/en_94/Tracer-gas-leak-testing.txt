A tracer-gas leak testing method is a nondestructive testing method that detects gas leaks. A variety of methods with different sensitivities exist. Tracer-gas leak testing is used in the petrochemical industry, the automotive industry, and in the manufacture of semiconductors, among other uses. ==Types== Several tracer-gas leak testing methods exist, including: * Detection of leaks using helium mass spectrometer, which provides high sensitivity * Hydrogen leak testing, which provides the best mobility * Refrigerant gas leak detection, for refrigeration applications == Method selection == === Typical leakage rates === The nature of the product or the process and the process gases will set the leak rate requirement: {| class="wikitable" !System !Allowed leak rate (mbar l/s) |- |Chemical process equipment |10-1-1 |- |Beverage can |10-5 -10-6 |- |Vacuum pumped system |10-5-10-7 |- |IC-package |10-7-10-8 |- |Airbag cartridge |10-8 |- |Pacemaker |10-9 |- |Closed vacuum system |10-9 |} === Sensitivity of methods === Based on the target leak rate, the table below will help to choose the most suitable method. {| class="wikitable" !Method !Sensitivity (leak rate in mbar l/s) |- |Ultrasonics |10-1|10-1 |- |Bubble test in water |10-2 |- |Pressure decay |10-2 |- |Vacuum decay |10-2 |- |Acoustic emission detectors |10-3 |- |Bubble test in soapy water |10-4 |- |Gas-specific thermal conductivity detector |10-5 |- |Halogen detector |10-5 |- |Photoacoustic spectroscopy |10-6 |- |Hydrogen sniffer |10-6 |- |Residual gas analyser |10-7 |- |Dye penetrant |10-8 |- |Radioactive tracer |10-10 |- |Helium mass spectrometry vacuum testing |10-11 |} == Applications == Typical applications of tracer-gas leak testing include: * In petrochemical plants, hydrocracking, vapocracking, catalytic reforming, and steam reforming are all hydrogen-based processes, in which were hydrogen leak testing is required. * When manufacturing semiconductors, all processes taking place in a process chamber at atmospheric pressure or under vacuum - diffusion, oxidation, LPCVD, PECVD, PVD and ion implantation - require helium or hydrogen leak testing. * In vehicles, airbags have to be tested for leaks so they remain functional for a long time. As well as airbags, the air conditioning system, fuel system, and exhaust system require testing for leaks. * Pacemakers and catheters have to be tested for efficacy and longevity. * On planes, tracer-gas leak testing is used to quickly and safely locate fuel leaks, as well as to check oxygen distribution devices and cabin pressurization systems. * Refrigeration and air conditioning must have the lowest possible rate of loss of refrigerant gases (contributing to ozone depletion). * Sewage and drinking water networks, to reduce loss of water and make sure drinking water is not contaminated by sewage. ==Standards== Several standards apply to leak testing and more specifically to tracer-gas leak testing methods, for example: * BS EN 1779:1999; leak tightness by indication or measurement of gas leakage, * BS EN 13185:2001 Non-destructive testing. Leak testing. Tracer gas method, * BS EN 13192:2002 Non-destructive testing. Leak testing.
