He found the dialogues to be of uneven quality while the fragmented narrative gave a lightness to the film. The critic wrote: "The Dance is the best Icelandic film of the last year and raises hopes of a brighter future for the industry." Variety's Leonard Klady wrote: > Helmer's graceful, precise style contrasts sharply with the howling winds > and fierce rains that pummel the characters. Tech credits are richly hued > and amplified by a haunting score that incorporates traditional folk music. > The cast is vividly drawn, down to the tiniest part. ===Accolades=== The film won the prize for Best Cinematography at Festroia and Best Director at the Moscow International Film Festival. At the 1999 Edda Awards, Thorunn Maria Jonsdottir received the prize for Best Costumes. The film was also nominated for Best Film, Director and Actor (Dofri Hermannsson).
