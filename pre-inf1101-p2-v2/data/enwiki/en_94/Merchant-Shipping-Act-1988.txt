The Merchant Shipping Act 1988 c.12 was an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom. It aimed to prevent foreign fishing fleets from fishing in British territorial waters. In the Factortame case, its provisions in Parts I and II, Registration of British Ships, were disapplied by the House of Lords when they were found to conflict with European Community law and the Common Fisheries Policy. Part II dealt only with fishing vessels and was found to be repugnant by the European Court of Justice. The subsequent definition of British Ships is found in the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. ==See also== *Merchant Shipping Act ==External links== * The text of the statute as amended and (not) in force today from the Statute Law Database Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1988 Category:Shipping in the United Kingdom Category:Fisheries law
