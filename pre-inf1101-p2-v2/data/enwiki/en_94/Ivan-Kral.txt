Ivan Kral (12 May 1948 - 2 February 2020) was a Czech-born American composer, filmmaker, record producer, bass guitar player, and singer-songwriter. He worked across genres including punk, rock, jazz, soul, country and film scores. His songs have been recorded by such artists as U2, Pearl Jam, Telephone, Patti Smith, Iggy Pop, David Bowie, Simple Minds, First Aid Kit, and John Waite, among others. He died of cancer in 2020, aged 71. ==Early life== Born in Prague, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic), Ivan Kral moved to the United States in 1966 as a refugee with his parents, who were diplomats. His father Dr. Karel Kral, a reporter at the United Nations, brought worldwide attention to the pending Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and publicly denounced the action, subsequently deciding not to return. Kral had refugee status until 1981 when he obtained U.S. citizenship. ==Early career and The Patti Smith Group== Kral's American music career began during the early 1970s glam rock scene in New York. His band, Luger, which also featured drummer Shayne Harris, performed at venues including Max's Kansas City, and opened for Kiss at the early shows at the Hotel Diplomat in 1973. After their breakup in 1973, he joined Shaun Cassidy's backing group, then Blondie, then Patti Smith, then Iggy Pop. Between 1975 and 1979, Kral was co-writer, guitarist and bassist of the Patti Smith Group on her first four albums; including debut, Horses (1975), named one of the All-Time 100 Greatest Albums by Time magazine in 2006.Tyrangiel, Josh (13 November 2006). "Horses by Patti Smith". The All-TIME 100 Albums. United States: Time. Retrieved 2 January 2010. The album is in the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress, for recordings considered "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". His work also appears on other Smith albums, including Radio Ethiopia (1976), Easter (1978) and Wave (1979). Some of Kral's songs written during this period include "Ask the Angels", "Pissing in a River", "25th Floor", "Revenge", "Citizen Ship", "Birdland", "Ain't It Strange", "Pumping (My Heart)" and her hit "Dancing Barefoot", which Rolling Stone included in its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and has been recorded by artists including U2, Simple Minds and Pearl Jam. ==Film-making work== Kral wanted a visual diary of his days in America in case he was ever deported back home to Czechoslovakia where rock music was forbidden, so he bought a Super 8 camera from a pawn shop. He began filming at Murray the K shows in 1968, then eventually got a 16mm camera, on which he filmed other concerts. Some of the clips appear in his 1975 amateur compilation, Night Lunch. Kral also filmed his bandmates and friends at rehearsals, Hotel Chelsea apartments, The Bottom Line, and CBGB. He compiled the footage into a 1976 film titled The Blank Generation, which features the Ramones, Talking Heads, Blondie, New York Dolls, Television, and drag queen Jayne County, before they had record deals. No Wave filmmaker Amos Poe helped Kral edit the film by adding music from each band's cassettes and cutting irrelevant scenes. The Blank Generation D-I-Y clip compilation is often referred to as the original visual document of the birth of New York punk. There are no effects, production, posing, scripts or budget, and it is the source film for many music documentaries worldwide. Kral also shot three short films from 1976 to 1979 titled "Rat", "Raven", and "Rabbit", documenting his days in the Patti Smith Group, with her band backstage and onstage. ==After The Patti Smith Group== In 1979, after Patti Smith's last show in Florence, Italy, Iggy Pop invited Kral to Rockfield Studios in Wales to work on his album Soldier, produced by Pat Moran. After the Soldier tour, Kral became Iggy's co-writer and guitarist for all the original songs on his 1981 album, Party. Kral hoped to build a career as a film composer by heading to Los Angeles to compose music for the Barry Levinson film Diner (1981), but eventually returned to New York. He wrote and recorded the film scores for three films by underground filmmaker Amos Poe, titled, Unmade Beds, The Foreigner and Subway Riders in his apartment on his mini Moog synthesizer, piano and guitar. In the 1980s Kral was involved in a number of short-term projects. He recorded and toured with John Waite, former singer with The Babys, and co-wrote songs for his album Ignition. Kral wrote songs for many other artists, including Mick Ronson, and was involved in rehearsals with British guitarist Chris Spedding and John Cale, formerly of the Velvet Underground, to create a new band, but it never materialized. Kral subsequently formed his own band, Eastern Bloc, with a record deal and video with Passport Records, though the project ended when the label folded in the mid 1980s. Kral also ran a studio in New York from 1982 to 1993, named PAWS, where Mick Jagger, The B-52's, and reggae artists like Kiddus I rehearsed.amazon - Rising of the Phoenix - Ragz Mo' Rocka ==Return to Czech Republic== In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell and the Velvet Revolution brought Communism to an end in Czechoslovakia. Kral returned to Prague in 1993, and began working with other rock artists to develop the new Czech rock scene, using his experiences in the west to develop Czech talent and working as a songwriter, producer and musician. Patti Smith, while still living in Detroit, recorded her poem "Perfect Moon" at 54 Sound studio for Kral's 1995 album Nostalgia. John Cale wrote and recorded the piano for the song. Kral worked from his home studio in Ann Arbor, Michigan. His album, Always (2014), was recorded in Detroit and released on Warner Music Czech Republic. His previous ten albums were released on Universal Music Group and Polygram and were recorded in the Czech Republic or in Seattle. As a producer, Kral worked with The Vipers and the Band of Outsiders, as well as Czech bands such as Lucie (on their studio album Cerny kocky mokry zaby) and David Koller, Ivan Hlas, Jiri Suchy, Aneta Langerova, Miroslav Zbirka, Alice,ivankral.net - Ivan was Producer for 1995 album by Czech rock band Alice Debbi, Triny, and Garage. He also released many solo albums. He was a collector of the work of the avant- garde Czech photographer Frantisek Drtikol. The video for his song "Winner Takes All" was inspired by Drtikol's work with the female form. Kral wrote music for the memorial of President Vaclav Havel, and performed it for live broadcast across the Czech Republic following Havel's funeral at St. Vitus Cathedral. == Filmography == * "Deliberately Raw: Iggy & the Stooges" (1973) * "Rat (Patti Smith Group)" (1976) * "Raven (Patti Smith Group)" (1977) * "Rabbit (Patti Smith Group)" (1979) === Director === * Night Lunch - glam and rock band compilation (1975) * The Blank Generation (1976) * Iggy and the Stooges: Live at Academy of Music New York City (2011) === Self === * The Blank Generation (1976) * Rockpalast: Patti Smith Group - on bass guitar and as backing vocalist (1979) * Dancing Barefoot (1995) * Mnaga - Happy End (1996) * Cabriolet (2001) * Patrani po Ester - Documentary (2005) * Letem svetem s Kuretem - TV Movie (2011) * Show Jana Krause - Episode dated 29 April 2011 - TV Series (2011) * Show Jana Krause - Episode dated 5 October 2012 - TV Series (2012) * VIP zpravy - Episode dated 16 April 2014 - TV Series (2014) == Discography == === Solo === * Native (1992) * Nostalgia (1995) * Looking Back (1996) * Native: His Native Complete (1996) * Alias (1997) (with Ivan Hlas, David Koller and Karel Sucha) * Modre z nebe (soundtrack) (1997) * Prohlednuti / Clear Eyes (1998) * ...
