Rose Isle from upstream The former Swan Inn on Rose Isle Rose Isle is an island in the River Thames in England just downstream of Kennington Railway Bridge on the reach above Sandford Lock, near Kennington, Oxfordshire. The island is tree-covered and has a narrow channel behind it crossed by a footbridge. It was formerly used for the growing of osiers (basket willows, used for basketry, furniture, and cart-making). The house on the island replaces the Swan Hotel which was formerly a well-known stopping point on the river. The island was also known in the past as Kennington Island or St Michael's Island. ==See also== *Islands in the River Thames ==References== * Leigh Hatts. The Thames path: from the sea to the source.
