Gonyeli (; ) is a town in Cyprus, near the capital city Nicosia. It is de facto under the control of Northern Cyprus. Over the years the town has merged with North Nicosia, making it connurbated with the city. Its population is 11,671. == History == Before the Ottoman conquest of Cyprus in 1571, the area consisted of empty fields. Upon the conquest, two families from Anatolia settled and founded Gonyeli, that of Kurt Ali from Anamur and Mehmet Efendi from Aksaray. Over time, as the families grew in population, the village grew as a farming community speaking Turkish. ==Culture== The football club Gonyeli Spor Kulubu is based in Gonyeli. Gonyeli's stadium, Ali Naci Karacan Stadi (named for journalist Ali Naci Karacan), houses football matches as well as concerts and the annual 23 April Children's Day events. Every July, the Gonyeli International Folk Dance Festival takes place in the town center. The event lasts one week, with groups of dancers from countries such as Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey performing traditional folk dance. Gonyeli is a popular town for students looking to rent accommodation as it is about 15 minutes driving distance from the Nicosia-based Near East University. ==International relations== ===Twin towns - sister cities=== Gonyeli is twinned with: * Kizilcahamam, Ankara, Turkey (since 2009) * Sariyer, Istanbul, Turkey ==References== Category:Communities in Nicosia District Category:Populated places in Lefkosa District Category:Suburbs of Nicosia Category:Municipalities of Northern Cyprus
