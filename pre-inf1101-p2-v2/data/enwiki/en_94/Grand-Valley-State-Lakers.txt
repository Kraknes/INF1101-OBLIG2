The Lakers finished as national runner-up in 2012 and 2013. The hockey team is a "varsity club", in that it is not an official NCAA sport, but is run as a varsity program and maintains the third-highest average attendance of all GVSU sports (behind Football and Basketball). === Rowing === Founded in 1964 by Coach Charles Irwin, rowing was the first varsity sport at Grand Valley State University. Today GVSU now supports a successful coed club crew. Each year the team travels around the nation and world to compete against other top collegiate crews. In the fall it competes in Boston at the Head of the Charles Regatta, regularly earning medals in the Men's and Women's Collegiate 8+s, as well as occasionally fielding an alumni entry. Each spring GVSU hosts the Lubbers Cup Regatta in Spring Lake, Michigan. The Cup is named for the former GVSU president, Arend Lubbers. The team has been successful in the past and took fifth in the Dad Vails points trophy in 2006, and second to Purdue in 2008. The top men's and women's Varsity Eight were competitors at the prestigious Henley Royal Regatta in England in 2004 and 2008. In 2004 the men's and women's teams took bronze at the International Race of Eights in Zagreb, Croatia. Several alumni of the rowing program at GVSU have gone on to race at the elite level.

The Lakers went into the championship tournament ranked 2nd in America and with an 18-0 record in MCLA play. After a first round bye the Lakers defeated Southwestern University, and were slotted to play a re-match against The University of St. Thomas (who the Lakers defeated earlier in the season by 1 in overtime) In Texas Stadium (Former Home of the Dallas Cowboys), the Lakers went on to win the game earning a spot to play in the MCLA Div. 2 National Championship game.

The 2009 Laker lacrosse team finished with a 10-4 record, with losses coming to the 1-4 nationally ranked teams. The Lakers ended their season in the CCLA Division 2 semi-final losing to national runners up University of Dayton. Due to powers beyond their control, the Lakers also were slightly edged from being invited to the National Championship tournament despite having its only 4 losses to the nations top 4 teams. The 2010 Laker Lacrosse team finished with a record of 15-4, going undefeated in CCLA play, winning the CCLA North Championship, and taking second place in the CCLA tournament. The Lakers were invited to participate for their 2nd time in the MCLA National Championship tournament. The Lakers were ousted early from the tournament by cross town rivals Davenport Panthers who were finally able to get the best of the Lakers in their third meeting of the season. In 2011 The Lakers jumped out to impressive early season victories and earned a top national ranking for a three-month period. The Lakers finished the regular season undefeated, won the CCLA conference tournament, and earned a number one seed to the MCLA National Championship tournament.

The music was composed by GVSU (then GVSC) band director William Root. The lyrics were written by GVSC band members Maris Tracy and Kathleen Ure. The lyrics by Tracy and Ure were selected as the winning submission on October 25, 1978 after a contest sponsored by the Office of Student Life and the Student Senate. GVSU Victory has undergone minor changes since it was officially introduced in 1978. Two versions of the song currently exist, although there is no difference in the lyrics, and only minor variations in the music. The song has been sung, incorrectly, with the word "on" replacing the word "at" in the last line of the first stanza. Additionally, some people chant "Let's Go Blue Fight!" between the two stanzas. However, this prevents the singer from correctly beginning the second without truncating "We want a" from the first line. Although "GO LAKERS!" has been part of the song since its inception, in actuality, it is almost always absent. ==References== ==External links== *
