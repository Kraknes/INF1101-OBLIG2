In linguistics, the term T-unit was coined by Kellogg Hunt in 1965.Hunt, K. (1965). Grammatical structures written at three grade levels. NCTE Research report No. 3. Champaign, IL, USA: NCTE. It is defined as the "shortest grammatically allowable sentences into which (writing can be split) or minimally terminable unit." Often, but not always, a T-unit is a sentence. More technically, a T-unit is a dominant clause and its dependent clauses: as Hunt said, it is "one main clause with all subordinate clauses attached to it" (Hunt 1965:20). T-units are often used in the analysis of written and spoken discourse, such as in studies on errors in second language writing. The number of error-free T-units may be counted, as in Robb et al. (1986),Robb, T., Ross, S., & Shortreed, I. (1986). Salience of feedback on error and its effect on EFL writing quality. TESOL Quarterly, 20, 83-93. or changes in accuracy per T-unit over drafts of compositions may be measured (Sachs and Polio, 2007).Sachs, R. and Polio, C. (2007).Learners' uses of two types of written feedback on a L2 writing revision task. Studies in Second Language Acquisition, 29:67-100. Young (1995) gives some examples of what a T-unit is and is not: > "The following elements were counted as one T-unit: a single clause, a > matrix plus subordinate clause, two or more phrases in apposition, and > fragments of clauses produced by ellipsis. Co-ordinate clauses were counted > as two t-units. Elements not counted as t-units include backchannel cues > such as mhm and yeah, and discourse boundary markers such as okay, thanks or > good. False starts were integrated into the following t-unit."
