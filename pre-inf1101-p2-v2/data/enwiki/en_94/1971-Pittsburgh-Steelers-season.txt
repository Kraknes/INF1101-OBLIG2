The 1971 Pittsburgh Steelers season was the team's 39th in the National Football League. The Steelers showed improvement finishing in second Place with a 6-8 record. But Terry Bradshaw struggled with turnovers in his second season throwing 22 interceptions to 13 touchdown passes. The Steelers that year drafted wide receiver Frank Lewis, Hall of Fame linebacker Jack Ham, guard Gerry Mullins, defensive end Dwight White, tight end/tackle Larry Brown, defensive tackle Ernie Holmes, and safety Mike Wagner, all key contributors during the Steelers Super Bowl teams of the 1970s. == Offseason == === NFL Draft === {| class="wikitable" |+ !Round !Pick !Player !Position !College !Notes |- |1 |8 |Frank Lewis |WR |Grambling | |- |2 |34 |Jack Ham |LB |Penn State | |- |3 |60 |Steven Davis |RB |Delaware State | |- |4 |86 |Gerry Mullins |TE |USC | |- |4 |104 |Dwight White |DE |East Texas State | |- |5 |106 |Larry Brown |TE |Kansas | |- |5 |112 |Melvin Holmes |OT |North Carolina A&T; | |- |5 |126 |Ralph Anderson |DB |West Texas State | |- |5 |128 |Fred Brister |LB |Mississippi | |- |6 |138 |Craig Hanneman |OT |Oregon State | |- |7 |164 |Worthy McClure |OT |Mississippi | |- |8 |184 |Larry Crowe |RB |Texas Southern | |- |8 |190 |Paul Rogers |PK |Nebraska | |- |8 |203 |Ernie Holmes |DT |Texas Southern | |- |9 |216 |Mike Anderson |LB |LSU | |- |10 |242 |Jim O'Shea |TE |Boston College | |- |11 |268 |Mike Wagner |DB |Western Illinois | |- |13 |320 |Alfred Young |WR |South Carolina State | |- |14 |346 |McKinney Evans |DB |New Mexico Highlands | |- |15 |372 |Ray Makin |OG |Kentucky | |- |16 |398 |Walter Huntley |DB |Trinity | |- |17 |424 |Danny Ehle |RB |Howard Payne | |} ==Personnel== ===Staff=== ===Roster=== == Regular season == ===Schedule=== {| class="wikitable" |- !
