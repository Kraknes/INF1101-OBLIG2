George Cross and its ribbon bar ===George Cross=== On 20 August 1946, German high explosive bombs were being loaded onto barges for disposal at sea when a bomb was dropped and exploded, killing six and injuring 12. Two train loads of bombs were ready for loading and the port area, in the centre of Lubeck, was evacuated. Squadron Leader Dinwoodie (while on attachment to the 5140 (Bomb Disposal) Squadron, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve) and Corporal Roland Garred were sent to the scene and defused one of the remaining bombs in the batch to discover that a faulty fuse had caused the accident. They rendered the remaining 11 bombs safe when another explosion would have not only killed them but set off the bomb laden trains and devastated the town centre. Leading Aircraftman John Hatton, the driver in the bomb disposal team, also assisted in moving the bombs. Awarded the George Cross on 4 February 1947, the citation in the London Gazette praised Dinwoodie for displaying Garred was awarded the George Medal, while Hatton received the British Empire Medal. Dinwoodie relinquished his commission in the RAFVR with effect from 10 February 1954, retaining the rank of wing commander. Hubert's medals and some photographs are held by the RAF Museum at Hendon, London. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1896 births Category:1968 deaths Category:British recipients of the George Cross Category:Royal Air Force recipients of the George Cross Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:People from Bournemouth Category:Recipients of the Military Cross Category:Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve personnel of World War II Category:Dorset Regiment officers Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:Bomb disposal personnel
