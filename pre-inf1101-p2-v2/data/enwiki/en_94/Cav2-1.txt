The Cav2.1 P/Q voltage-dependent calcium channel is encoded by the gene. == Function == Voltage-dependent calcium channels mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells, and are also involved in a variety of calcium- dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. Calcium channels are multisubunit complexes composed of alpha-1, beta, alpha-2/delta, and gamma subunits. The channel activity is directed by the pore-forming alpha-1 subunit, whereas, the others act as auxiliary subunits regulating this activity. The distinctive properties of the calcium channel types are related primarily to the expression of a variety of alpha-1 isoforms, alpha-1A, B, C, D, E, and S. This gene encodes the alpha-1A subunit, which is predominantly expressed in neuronal tissue. == Clinical significance == Mutations in this gene are associated with multiple neurologic disorders, many of which are episodic, such as familial hemiplegic migraine, movement disorders such as episodic ataxia, and epilepsy with multiple seizure types. This gene also exhibits polymorphic variation due to (CAG)n-repeats. Multiple transcript variants have been described, however, the full-length nature of not all is known. In one set of transcript variants, the (CAG)n-repeats occur in the 3' UTR, and are not associated with any disease. However, in another set of variants, an insertion extends the coding region to include the (CAG)n-repeats which encode a polyglutamine tract. Expansion of the (CAG)n-repeats from the normal 4-16 to 21-28 in the coding region is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia 6. == Interactions == Cav2.1 has been shown to interact with CACNB4. == References == == Further reading == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * == Further reading == * * In * In * Category:Ion channels
