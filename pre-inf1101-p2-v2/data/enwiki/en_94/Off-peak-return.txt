The Off-Peak Return is a type of train ticket used on National Rail services in Great Britain. The ticket was introduced as the Saver Return by British Rail in 1985,http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr37/pdf/f26_hat.pdf being rebranded to its current name on 7 September 2008.http://www.atoc.org/media-centre/atoc-press- releases/2008/04/24/atoc-announces-simpler-rail-fares-100120/ == Variants == The Off-Peak Return is complemented by various sister products, with the full range comprising: {| class="wikitable" |- !

As the name implies, the ticket is generally intended for use outside peak times. Typically train operating companyies prevent use of this type of ticket during key commuting hours of weekday mornings and early evening, especially for services beginning or terminating in London, at which times higher fares may be charged. The times at which an Off-Peak fare is valid are set by the relevant train operator according to various factors, from levels of peak demand on the route in question to revenue maximisation. The specific details are given by referring to the two-digit 'validity code' assigned to the fare. The simplest apply a simple blanket time period to both outward and return journeys; more complex validity codes may apply different restrictions to outward and return journeys, or combine general validity periods with train-specific exemptions or exclusions. Passengers are entitled to pause and resume their journey at any point and any number of times unless the ticket's validity code specifically prohibits this. === Validity examples === {| class="wikitable" |- ! Validity Code !! Time Restrictions !! Break of Journey |- | 2V || Not valid to depart before 0930 weekdays. || Allowed |- | 8A || Valid any time. || Prohibited |- | EF || Valid after 1830 only. || Allowed |- | SK || Not valid on trains arriving in London before 1000 or departing London before 0845 weekdays. || Allowed return leg only |- | SM || Not valid on trains arriving in London before 1121 weekdays.

The gradual introduction of ticket barriers across stations is removing this misuse as the ticket is retained by the barrier upon completing the journey. == References == Category:Passenger rail transport in the United Kingdom
