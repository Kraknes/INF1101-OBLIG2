He was born on 13 December 1918, at Enfield, New South Wales. His award was noted in the London Gazette of 1 February 1972, and the citation describes how throughout the period he had been working with the Tolai people of the Gazelle Peninsula, resolving factional conflicts, and restoring local government. On several occasions, despite the danger, he left his police escort to conduct negotiations single-handedly, despite the danger. On 19 August 1971 he did so again, despite the fact that some of the dissidents were in war paint. He was killed shortly after beginning negotiations. ==References== Category:Australian recipients of the George Cross Category:People from the Inner West (Sydney) Category:1918 births Category:1971 deaths
