Jornal da Globo (Globo Journal) is the late night news show broadcast by the Brazilian television channel Rede Globo. It doesn't have a fixed starting time, but usually airs at or after midnight, Monday to Friday evenings. Hosted by Renata Lo Prete it shows a detailed summary of the news of the day, highlighting matters such as Brazilian and world's economics and politics. It's eventually hosted by Carlos Tramontina and Marcio Gomes. Jornal da Globo was originally launched in 1967 as replacement for Tele Globo as Rede Globo's first newscast, hosted by Hilton Gomes and Luiz Jatoba. Its first incarnation ended in March 1969 just months before the launch of Jornal Nacional. Jornal da Globo was relaunched for a second time in 1979 and hosted by Sergio Chapelin, ending again in 1981 before being relaunched for a third time in its current incarnation in 1982. == Presenter == * Renata Lo Pretehttps://g1.globo.com/google/amp/https://g1.globo.com/economia/midia-e- marketing/noticia/renata-lo-prete-e-a-titular-do-jornal-da-globo-e-heraldo- pereira-do-jornal-das-dez.ghtml == Commentators == * Carlos Alberto Sardenberg - economy * Heraldo Pereira - policy * Andre Trigueiro - Ecology * Arnaldo Jabor - general issues * Nelson Motta - culture * Samy Dana - personal finances * Luiz Roberto and Cleber Machado - Sports == Ex-holders == * Hilton Gomes (1967 - 1969) * Luiz Jatoba (1967 - 1969) * Sergio Chapelin (1979 - 1981) * Renato Machado (1982 - 1983) * Belisa Ribeiro (1982 - 1983) * Luciana Villas Boas (1982 - 1983) * Leilane Neubarth (1983 - 1986) * Eliakim Araujo (1983 - 1989) * Leila Cordeiro (1986 - 1989) * William Bonner (1989 - 1992) * Fatima Bernardes (1989 - 1992) * Lilian Witte Fibe (1993 - 1996/1998 - 2000) * Monica Waldvogel (1996 - 1997) * Sandra Annenberg (1997 - 1998) * Carlos Tramontina (2000) * Ana Paula Padrao (2000 - 2005) * Chico Pinheiro (2005) * Cristiane Pelajo (2005 - 2015) * William Waack (2005 - 2017) ==Presenter Eventual== * Carlos Tramontina - 1997-2000/2017-present ==Former any== * Celso Freitas (1982 - 1990) * Leda Nagle (1982 - 1989) * Eliakim Araujo (1982 - 1983) * Marcus Hummel (1985 - 1993) * Augusto Xavier [1986-1994] * Fatima Bernardes (1987 - 1989) * Lilian Witte Fibe (1988 - 1993) * William Bonner (1988 - 1989) * Monica Waldvogel (1992 - 1996 and 1999) * Cristina Ranzolin (1993) * Sandra Annenberg (1993 - 1997) * Mona Dorf (1998 - 1999) * Carlos Tramontina (1997 - 2000) * Chico Pinheiro (2000 - 2005) * William Waack (2000 - 2005) * Carlos Alberto Sardenberg (2012 - 2014) * Poliana Abritta (2012 - 2014) * Zileide Silva (2014) * Renata Lo Prete (2015-2017) == See also == * Rede Globo ==References== == External links == *Official Site Category:1967 Brazilian television series debuts Category:Rede Globo original programming Category:Brazilian television news shows Category:Portuguese-language television shows Category:Flagship evening news shows
