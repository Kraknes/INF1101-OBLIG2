Amor de Hombre (also known as Love of a Man in English-speaking markets) is a 1997 Spanish gay-themed drama film. An intimate, warm and tender Spanish film about the very close friendship between a gay man and a straight woman. The writer/directors of Km. 0 collaborated on this comedy/drama. The film won both the Audience and Jury awards at the Miami Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and Narrative Feature at the Austin Gay & Lesbian Film Festival. ==Synopsis== Ramon is a sexually active gay man with men coming and going from his bedroom. His best friend Esperanza is a single woman who can't seem to meet or like any men unless they are gay. Some would call Esperanza a fag hag, but she simply has great taste in men, she likes them gay! They go out together to the bars and Ramon always brings a man home while Esperanza goes home to an empty bed. She doesn't mind because she knows that she has Ramon's heart. That is until Ramon meets her fellow teacher, Roberto. Their relationship endangers the precious bond these two have formed. This colorful and somewhat hyper-active film is in the style of Almodovar. There's always plenty of on-screen action, dialogue and color to keep the eyes and ears happy. It's a tender and intimate peek into the lives of two people that one seldom sees on screen. It seems as if Madrid is teeming with gorgeous gay men, after seeing Amor de Hombre it should be a stop in every gay man's life. ==Cast== *Loles Leon as Esperanza *Andrea Occhipinti as Ramon *Pedro Mari Sanchez as Cesar *Armando Del Rio as Roberto ==Awards== Freedom Award - 2000 Outfest Audience & Jury Award for Best Feature - 1999 Miami LG Film Festival Best Narrative Feature - 1998 Austin GL Film Festival ==Festivals== 1999 Miami Lesbian & Gay Film Festival 1999 Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film Festival 23rd San Francisco LGBT Film Festival ==External links== * TLA Releasing - Amor de Hombre Category:1997 films Category:1997 drama films Category:Spanish films Category:Spanish-language films Category:Spanish LGBT-related films Category:Madrid in fiction Category:Gay-related films Category:LGBT-related drama films Category:Spanish drama films
