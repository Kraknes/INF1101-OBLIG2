After much consideration, Chuck Long delighted Iowa Hawkeye fans by declaring that he would return for his senior season. He became an instant Heisman Trophy candidate, and Iowa was a pre-season top five team. After three weeks in 1985, the Hawkeyes ascended to #1 in the national rankings. In Iowa's first game at #1, the Hawkeyes played Michigan State. A seesaw game had the Spartans leading 31-28 in the waning minutes. Long drove Iowa the length of the field, and the Hawkeyes faced fourth and goal from the two-yard line with just 27 seconds remaining. Since there was no overtime rule until 1996, Iowa needed to go for the touchdown and the win. Long faked a handoff to running back Harmon and then ran to his right. His fake had fooled the Spartan defenders, and Long ran into the endzone, holding the ball high above his head as he crossed the goal line to give Iowa a 35-31 victory. He completed a school record 30 passes on 39 attempts for 380 yards and scored five touchdowns (four passing and the game winning score rushing) in the game. Two weeks later, #1 Iowa faced #2 Michigan in Kinnick Stadium. Iowa trailed 10-9 as the Hawkeyes regained possession of the football at their own 22-yard line with just 5:27 remaining in the game.

That was uncharacteristic of him; I think he fumbled once during the > regular season. The game film reveals that every fumble he lost was caused > by a UCLA defender making a hard hit. They just knocked the ball loose. They > [UCLA] did a great job of tackling. UCLA made bad things happen to Iowa; > Iowa didn't self-destruct. Ronnie Harmon had a tremendous football career > with the Hawkeyes, and I hated to see it end that way."
