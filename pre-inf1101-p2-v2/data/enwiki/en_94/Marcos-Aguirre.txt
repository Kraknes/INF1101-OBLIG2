Marcos Sebastian Aguirre (born March 30, 1984 in Arroyito, Cordoba) is an Argentine football winger who plays for Deportivo Pasto in the Categoria Primera A. ==Career== Aguirre started his professional career in 2004 with Club Atletico Lanus, gradually establishing himself as an important member of the first team. In 2007, he was part of the squad that won the Apertura 2007 tournament, Lanus' first ever top flight title. In January 2008, Aguirre was loaned to Real Valladolid, being unsuccessful during a one 1/2 year stint, as he was mainly used as a substitute. He did, however, score on the last day of the 2008-09 season in a crucial relegation match away to Real Betis which ended 1-1, after having replaced injured Pedro Leon. Betis eventually relegated with that draw, but the Castile and Leon outfit maintained its status. Upon the end of his loan spell, Aguirre returned to Lanus in 2009. Back in Argentina, Aguirre scored the first goal of the 2010-11 Argentine Primera Division season in a 2-1 win over Arsenal de Sarandi. At the end of the semester, the winger was loaned again by Lanus, this time to Arsenal de Sarandi. ==Honours== {| class="wikitable" !Season !Team !Title |- |Apertura 2007 || Lanus || Argentine League |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Marcos Aguirre - Futbol XXI profile at Futbol XXI * * * * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:People from Cordoba Province, Argentina Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:Argentine Primera Division players Category:Club Atletico Lanus footballers Category:Arsenal de Sarandi footballers Category:La Liga players Category:Real Valladolid players Category:C.D.
