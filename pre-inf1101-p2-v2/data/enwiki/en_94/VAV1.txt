Proto-oncogene vav is a protein that in humans is encoded by the VAV1 gene. == Function == The protein encoded by this proto-oncogene is a member of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) for the Rho family of GTP binding proteins. The protein is important in hematopoiesis, playing a role in T-cell and B-cell development and activation. This particular GEF has been identified as the specific binding partner of Nef proteins from HIV-1. Coexpression and binding of these partners initiates profound morphological changes, cytoskeletal rearrangements and the JNK/SAPK signaling cascade, leading to increased levels of viral transcription and replication. == Interactions == VAV1 has been shown to interact with: * ARHGDIB, * Abl gene, * Cbl gene * EZH2, * Grb2, * JAK2, * Ku70, * LAT, * LCP2, * MAPK1, * PIK3R1, * PLCG1, * PRKCQ, * S100B, * SHB, * SIAH2, and * Syk. == References == == Further reading == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
