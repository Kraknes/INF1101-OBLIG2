By the mid to late 1980s, however, the number of dirty jokes had significantly decreased as the magazine changed its target demographic from only middle-aged salarymen to also include younger males in their late 20s and early 30s, as well as readers of josei manga and dojinshi. The current magazine includes a broad mix of manga, including those with anime tie-ins. Manga Life is one of the magazines which has changed the perception of yonkoma manga and manga artists as it has brought them more into the mainstream with its broad target audience. In the January issue every year, Mineo Maya has a guest manga appearance with his Nemuranai Eve series. ==Series== ===Current=== The following series are currently appearing in Manga Life.
