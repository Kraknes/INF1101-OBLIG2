Platelet-derived growth factor subunit B is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PDGFB gene. == Function == The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the platelet-derived growth factor family. The four members of this family are mitogenic factors for cells of mesenchymal origin and are characterized by a motif of eight cysteines. This gene product can exist either as a homodimer (PDGF-BB) or as a heterodimer with the platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFA) polypeptide (PDGF-AB), where the dimers are connected by disulfide bonds. == Clinical significance == Mutations in this gene are associated with meningioma. Reciprocal translocations between chromosomes 22 and 17, at sites where this gene and that for COL1A1 are located, are associated with a particular type of skin tumor called dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans resulting from unregulated expression of growth factor. Two splice variants have been identified for this gene. ==See also== *Platelet-derived growth factor ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Growth factors
