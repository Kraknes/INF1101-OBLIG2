Joao Esteves da Veiga de Napoles (1397-1461) was a Portuguese nobleman and Minister-Counselor, the eldest (and probably only) son of Leonardo Esteves de Napoles and his wife Margarida Anes Afonso. He was the 1st Lord (Senhor) of Salvaterra de Magos, Montargil, Vacarica and Vila Nova de Monsarros. De Napoles distinguished himself as a diplomat and later as member of the Privy Council of King John I of Portugal. Later in life, de Napoles founded the Honour of Molelos, a major lordship which would survive until the Liberal triumph of 1848. ==Marriage and children== De Napoles married Leonor Anes de Vasconcelos, daughter of Dom Joao Rodrigues de Vasconcelos, the Chief Governor (Mordomo-Mor) of King Afonso IV, and wife Constanca Soares. They had one son, Henrique Esteves da Veiga de Napoles, and two daughters, Catarina Anes da Veiga, first wife of Pedro Rodrigues Juzarte, and Margarida, wife of Vasco Pimentel and Luis Pereira. ==See also== *Honour (land) ==References== *Pereira Marques, Antonio Augusto.
