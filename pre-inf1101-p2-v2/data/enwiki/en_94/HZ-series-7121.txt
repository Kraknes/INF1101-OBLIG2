HZ series 7121 is a diesel multiple unit series of the Croatian Railways (), consisting of a motor wagon and a trailer. This unit is designed for commuter transport. These units are originally built under the licence of Macosa, Spain. == Overhaul == The overhauled DMU is now composed of two identical motor wagons. The auto-stop device manufactured by RIZ (Zagreb Radio Industry) has now also been built in. == Other railways == There are some units also existing on Serbian Railways, where the designated class number is class 712. A few units are in operation in Macedonia as well, with two of the units, named Heracleia and Skopje, serving the Heracleia Express on the Skopje-Bitola route. The 2 units are equipped with Wi-Fi internet, widescreen TV-s and a cafe bar. All the units differ from Serbian and Croat units by having 3 cars and a stronger Cummins engine, adapted for the mountainous Macedonian railways. ==Gallery== Image:HZ 7122 series DMU (01).JPG|HZ 7 121-001 Image:HZ 7121 128.jpg|HZ 7 121-128 Image:Macosa simultaneous 2.JPG| == External links == *Characteristics and some description 7121 Category:Duro Dakovic (company) Category:MACOSA
