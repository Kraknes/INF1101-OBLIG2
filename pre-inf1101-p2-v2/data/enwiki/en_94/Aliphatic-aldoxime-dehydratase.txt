In enzymology, an aliphatic aldoxime dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :an aliphatic aldoxime \rightleftharpoons an aliphatic nitrile + H2O This dehydratase converts an aldoxime on an aliphatic substrate to a nitrile as the product structure with water as byproduct. This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the "catch-all" class of lyases that do not fit into any other sub-class. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aliphatic aldoxime hydro-lyase (aliphatic-nitrile-forming). Other names in common use include OxdA, and aliphatic aldoxime hydro-lyase. ==See also== * D-amino acid oxidase, sometimes also referred to as OXDA ==References== * * * Category:EC 4.99.1 Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
