The Wascana Trails (formally known as Wascana Valley Nature Recreation Site) are a series of interconnected hiking and mountain biking trails in Canada, offering 15 km of marked trails. They are located 8 km northwest of Regina, Saskatchewan in a deep ravine carrying a tributary of the Qu'Appelle River. It is the largest mountain biking destination in the Regina area, offering trails of all difficulty levels. The more difficult trails climb in and out of the valley, while the easier ones are located in the bottom of the valley and are mostly flat. The trails were developed for use in the 2005 Canada Games and are currently preserved as a Provincial Recreation Site. ==References== Category:Hiking trails in Saskatchewan Category:Parks in Regina, Saskatchewan Category:Mountain biking venues in Canada Category:Sherwood No. 159, Saskatchewan Category:Division No. 6, Saskatchewan
