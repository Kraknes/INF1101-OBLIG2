Gottesgab ("Gift of God") was founded as a mining town by decree of the Wettin elector John Frederick I of Saxony, who acquired the lordship in 1533. Together with neighbouring Horni Blatna (Platten), John Frederick had to cede the town to the Habsburg lands of the Bohemian Crown in 1547 after the Schmalkaldic War and his defeat in the Battle of Muhlberg. After World War I, Bozi Dar became part of the First Czechoslovak Republic. It was mainly settled by Sudeten Germans and was one of the municipalities in Sudetenland annexed during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938. After World War II the German population was expelled, with only 189 inhabitants remaining in 1947. The historic town privileges were lost in the 1950s, but restored in 2006. ==Notable people== *Kaspar Eberhard (1523-1575), Lutheran theologian, local pastor in 1554 *Nikos Kazantzakis (1883-1957), Greek writer, spent several months in Myslivny between 1929 and 1932 *Lukas Bauer (born 1977), cross country skier, lives in Bozi Dar ==References== ==External links== * *Official website Category:Populated places in Karlovy Vary District Category:Cities and towns in the Czech Republic Category:Towns in the Ore Mountains
