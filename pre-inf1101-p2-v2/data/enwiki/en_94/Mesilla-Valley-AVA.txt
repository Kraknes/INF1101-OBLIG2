The Mesilla Valley AVA is an American Viticultural Area located primarily in the state of New Mexico with a small area in the state of Texas. Spanish explorer Don Juan de Onate arrived in the area in 1598 and named a Native American village in the valley Trenquel de la Mesilla, from which the valley as a whole became known as Mesilla Valley. Although viticulture began in nearby El Paso as early as 1650, grapes were first planted in the Mesilla Valley only in the early twentieth century, near the town of Dona Ana. The climate in the Mesilla Valley is dry and hot. ==See also== ;General * New Mexico wine * Texas wine ;Wineries * La Vina Winery * St. Clair Winery ==References== Category:American Viticultural Areas Category:Geography of New Mexico Category:Geography of Texas Category:New Mexico wine Category:Texas wine Category:1985 establishments in New Mexico Category:1985 establishments in Texas
