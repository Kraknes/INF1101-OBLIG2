Butyrate--CoA ligase, also known as xenobiotic/medium-chain fatty acid-ligase (XM-ligase), is an enzyme () that catalyzes the chemical reaction: :ATP + a carboxylic acid + CoA \rightleftharpoons AMP + diphosphate + an acyl-CoA The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, carboxylic acid, and CoA, whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and acyl-CoA. This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. This enzyme participates in the glycine conjugation of xenobiotics and butanoate metabolism. == Nomenclature == The systematic name of this enzyme class is butanoate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming). Other names in common use include: * butyryl-CoA synthetase, fatty acid thiokinase (medium chain), * acyl-activating enzyme, fatty acid elongate, * fatty acid activating enzyme, * fatty acyl coenzyme A synthetase, * medium chain acyl-CoA synthetase, * butyryl-coenzyme A synthetase, * L-(+)-3-hydroxybutyryl CoA ligase, * xenobiotic/medium-chain fatty acid ligase, and * short-chain acyl-CoA synthetase. ==Human proteins containing this domain== *ACSM1 *ACSM2A *ACSM2B *ACSM3 *ACSM4 *ACSM5 *ACSM6 ==References== * * * Category:EC 6.2.1 Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
