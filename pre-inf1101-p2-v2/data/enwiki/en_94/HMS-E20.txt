She was sunk, torpedoed by UB-14, on 6 November 1915. ==Design== Like all post-E8 British E-class submarines, E20 had a displacement of at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of and a beam length of . She was powered by two Vickers eight-cylinder two-stroke diesel engines and two electric motors.Akerman, P. (1989). Encyclopaedia of British submarines 1901-1955\. p.150. Maritime Books. The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of . British E-class submarines had fuel capacities of of diesel and ranges of when travelling at . E20 was capable of operating submerged for five hours when travelling at . E20 was fitted, possibly uniquely within her class, with a 6-inch Howitzer deck gun, forward of the conning tower. She had five 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, two in the bow, one either side amidships, and one in the stern; a total of 10 torpedoes were carried. E-class submarines had wireless systems with power ratings; in some submarines, these were later upgraded to systems by removing a midship torpedo tube. Their maximum design depth was although in service some reached depths of below . Some submarines contained Fessenden oscillator systems. ==Crew== Her complement was three officers and 28 men. ==Loss== Operating in the eastern Mediterranean, E20 was scheduled to rendez-vous with the on 6 November 1915.
