Kreditbanken is a former bank that was based in Stockholm, Sweden. Founded in 1923, it was merged with the Post Bank to form PK-Banken in 1974. PK-Banken purchased Nordbanken in 1980, after which it changed its name to Nordbanken, which in turn became part of Nordea. The Kreditbanken is notable in that the condition known as Stockholm syndrome was named for the Norrmalmstorg robbery that took place here.
