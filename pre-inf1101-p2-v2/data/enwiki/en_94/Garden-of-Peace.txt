The Garden of Peace in Boston, Massachusetts, is a memorial commemorating victims of homicide and a living reminder of the impact of violence. It is a visual testament to the need for eliminating violence. The Garden of Peace, is a memorial to homicide victims. It is a symbol of hope for peace and renewal in our lives, our community, and the world. The central feature of the memorial is a dry streambed containing smooth river stones engraved with the names of victims of homicide. The stream flows from a large, granite lens, "Tragic Density," that symbolizes the enormous weight of sadness and grief experienced and endured by the survivors. The streambed moves through the Garden and culminates in a cascade of water into a pool out of which rises "Ibis Ascending", a skyward sculpture representing hope. The seat walls throughout the Garden, also engraved with victims' names, offer a place to sit and reflect. It is a special place where families, friends, and the greater community can remember and celebrate the lives of those taken by violence. The Garden of Peace encourages change by raising awareness and by serving as an anti-violence educational tool. Local and statewide violence prevention and community-building organizations are welcome and incorporate visits to the Garden into their educational programs. Visitors to Boston are invited to enjoy the beauty of the Garden's park-like setting and to make the experience of the site part of their visit to historic Boston. Each year the Board of Directors and volunteers organize an event to dedicate the new names of homicide victims being added to the Garden. The Honor Program is usually held on the third Thursday in September. ==References== ==External Link== * Category:Landmarks in Boston Category:Peace gardens Category:Monuments and memorials in Boston Category:Peace monuments and memorials
