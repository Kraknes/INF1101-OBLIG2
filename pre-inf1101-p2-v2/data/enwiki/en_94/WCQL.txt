WCQL (95.9 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a Hot Adult Contemporary format. Licensed to Queensbury, New York, United States, the station serves the Saratoga Springs/Glens Falls area. The station is currently owned by Regional Radio Group, LLC and features live and local programming Johnny Ray with the Hits Hot Breakfast in the morning. Program Director John Pratt handles afternoon drive and oversees the rest of the staff at their new location in Queensbury, New York. ==History== The radio station began operations in September 1967 as WWSC-FM, originally licensed to Glens Falls, New York and simulcasting MOR formatted WWSC. In 1978, the call letters were changed to WYLR-FM, and the format to a syndicated, automated top 40 format called "The Love Rock", although the station still simulcasted programming with WWSC from 4:00AM-10:00AM weekdays. The format was flipped to automated album-oriented rock in 1981. The daily simulcast with WWSC ended completely in 1982 when a live morning show was added. During the 1980s the station added live midday and afternoon drive shifts. The format changed to an early version of hot adult contemporary in 1984, followed by dance top 40 in 1988 and then classic rock in 1991 as Y96. In late 1995, the format was changed to country (as North Country 95.9), but this only lasted until late 1997, when the station was sold, and the format was returned to classic rock, with the new call letters WCQL and the Cool Rock 95.9 branding. Classic rock lasted this time on WCQL for over seven years, until May 2005, when the station tweaked towards active rock due to new classic rock competition from the much more powerful classic hits-formatted WNYQ. In September 2005, the station flipped to its current hot adult contemporary format, Hits 95.9, due to competition from modern rock-leaning hot AC station WKBE. Due to WNYQ's move to Malta, New York, the station's community of license was changed to Queensbury, New York in 2006. ==Logos== File:WCQL former logo (Late 1997-February 2002).png|Former logo used between late 1997 and February 2002 File:WCQL former logo (Spring 2002-December 2003).png|Former logo used between March 2002 and December 2003 File:WCQL former logo (September 2005-December 2009).png|Former logo used between September 2005 and December 2009 File:WCQL former logo.png|Former logo used in 2010 and 2011 ==References== ==External links== CQL Category:Hot adult contemporary radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1967 Category:1967 establishments in New York (state)
