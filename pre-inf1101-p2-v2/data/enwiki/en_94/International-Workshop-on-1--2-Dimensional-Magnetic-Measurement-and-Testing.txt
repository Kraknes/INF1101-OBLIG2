International Workshop on 1 & 2 Dimensional Magnetic Measurement and Testing (commonly referred to as 1&2DM or even 2DM) - international meeting devoted to problems in one- and two-directional magnetisation of ferromagnetic materials. 16th Workshop ==Scope== * Basic problems, magnetisation processes, domain structures, Barkhausen noise * Aspects of industrial testing and standardisation * Power loss, polarisation, magnetostriction and anisotropy measurement * Magnetisation systems and sensors for 1 and 2D measurements * High frequency related aspects * B and H vector relationships and their interpretation * Relevance to applications (e.g., electrical machines, transformers, etc.). * Modelling of magnetic properties of materials, relevance of microstructures From the 8th 1&2DM the technical papers written in English are published in Przeglad Elektrotechniczny (which in Polish means Electric Review) issued in Warsaw, Poland.Przeglad Elektrotechniczny 2007/4 (branza Elektronika, Energetyka, Elektrotechnika) Przeglad Elektrotechniczny is one of the oldest European periodicals (since 1919), which is still being in print.Przeglad Elektrotechniczny From the 12th edition full conference papers have been published on the International Journal of Applied Electromagnetics and Mechanics- IJAEM,http://www.iospress.nl/journal/international-journal-of-applied- electromagnetics-and-mechanics/ (IOS Press, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). ==International Steering Committee== * Prof. Carlo Ragusa (Chair), Italy * Dr. Johannes Sievert (past Chair), Germany * Dr. Carlo Appino, Italy. * Prof. Luc Dupre, Belgium. * Prof. Masato Enokizono, Japan. * Dr. Fausto Fiorillo, Italy. * Dr Nicolas Galopin, France. * Prof. Yongjian Li, China. * Prof. Anthony J.
