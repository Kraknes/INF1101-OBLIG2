"Maybe Tomorrow" is a single from the Stereophonics' fourth studio album You Gotta Go There to Come Back (2003). ==Background== Written and produced by frontman Kelly Jones, it was used as the opening theme of the movie Wicker Park (2004) and was played during the credits at the end of the Academy Award- winning movie Crash (2004). It has more of a jazz ambience than some of their other songs; this and the whole album were considered a departure from the classic rock sound of previous album Just Enough Education to Perform. ==Reception and awards== The song became the band's second-highest chart position to date (alongside "The Bartender and the Thief"), peaking at number three on the UK Singles Chart in July 2003; it was their highest-charting song until "Dakota" reached number one in 2005. In January 2020 the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) awarded the song a Gold certification for sales and streams exceeding 400,000. Outside the United Kingdom, the song reached number 17 in the Netherlands, number 18 in Ireland, and number 33 in Italy. In the United States, the song became the second of three Stereophonics singles to appear on a Billboard chart, peaking at number five on the Adult Alternative Songs chart in January 2004. ==Track listing== CD1 #"Maybe Tomorrow" #"Have Wheels Will Travel" #"Change Changes Things" CD2 #"Maybe Tomorrow" - 4:32 #*Mixed by Jack Joseph Puig at Ocean Way, Hollywood, CA #*Second engineer at Ocean Way: Chris Steffen #"Madame Helga" - 3:54 #*Mixed by Jack Joseph Puig at Ocean Way, Hollywood, CA #*Second engineer at Ocean Way: Chris Steffen #"Royal Flush" (Mono Demo) - 3:29 #*Mixed by Jim Lowe #"Madame Helga" (Live at Glastonbury 2002) - 3:55 #*Mixed by Jim Lowe #"Maybe Tomorrow" (Video) #*Directed by W.I.Z.
