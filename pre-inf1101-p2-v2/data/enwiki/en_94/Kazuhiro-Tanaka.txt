is a Japanese professional drifting driver, currently competing in the D1 Grand Prix series for Team Orange and Yuke's. He first discovered drifting when riding in a friend's Toyota AE86 and he became hooked, as well of being part of Team Rough World which is more commonly now under RWB. As soon as he got his licence he bought a Toyota AE86 of his own and began practicing in the mountains, unluckily he soon had a nasty crash which almost caused him to give up drifting altogether. The next car he bought was a normally aspirated automatic Toyota Mark II with no LSD thinking that he wouldn't be able to drift it, he soon discovered he was wrong, and decided that he was just meant to drift. He then bought a Toyota Chaser JZX81 and soon started to enter competitions, eventually it ended up with many battle scars, and he was known as the guy with the broken down Chaser, but he didn't care as he adored the car. As well as being a D1 driver he works for M Sports, a well known body kit manufacturer and also competes in R/C car drifting competitions. He entered the D1 Grand Prix in the first round in 2001 and did well gaining his first win in 2003. He is a member of Team Orange with Nobushige Kumakubo and Naoto Suenaga and enjoys working on close tandem driving with them. He currently drives a Subaru Impreza converted to rear wheel drive which he can drift just as well as his old Nissan Silvia, though in 2007 he has not had a very good season. ==Complete Drifting Results== (key) ===D1 Grand Prix=== {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; font-size:95%" !
