Arms of Sir Thomas de Morley, 4th Baron Morley, KG Thomas de Morley, 4th Baron Morley, KG (c. 1354 - 24 September 1416) was a baron in the Peerage of England, Lord of Morley, Hingham, Hockering, &c.;, in Norfolk, de jure Lord Marshall, hereditary Earl Marshal of Ireland, and a Privy Councillor. He was summoned to parliament from 20 October 1379 to 3 September 1416. Thomas Morley was the second but eldest surviving son and heir of Sir William de Morley, 3rd Baron Morley (d. 30 April 1379) by his spouse Lady Cecily Bardolf (d. 23 November 1386), daughter of Thomas Bardolf, 2nd Baron Bardolf. In 1375 he was a Knight serving in Brittany in the expedition of the Duke of Brittany and Earl of Cambridge. In 1386, upon rumours of an intended invasion, he was, as Lord Morley, the Chief Commissioner ordered to survey Great Yarmouth and make provisions for its defence. In 1391 Lord Morley received permission to go on crusade in Prussia. In 1399 he accompanied King Richard II on his disastrous journey to Ireland. In July 1415 he set out with King Henry V on the expedition which culminated in the great victory of the Battle of Agincourt, but it does not appear, however, that he fought in the battle. In 1416 he was Lieutenant and Captain-General of forces assembled to proceed to France. Lord Morley died later that year at Calais, where he was lodging at the house of a merchant, After a service at the Church of Notre Dame in Calais, at which both King Henry V and Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, were present, his body was returned to England and buried in the Austin Friars Church at Norwich, Norfolk.
