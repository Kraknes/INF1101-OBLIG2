The programs offered are Academy of Health Professions, Automotive Service Technology, Business Management and Finance, Cosmetology, Culinary Arts and Restaurant Management, Environmental Science, Environmental Technology, Graphic/Print Communications Technology, Information Technology (with a choice between the Computer Science or Networking Pathway), Mechanical Construction/Plumbing and Sport Science Academy. The facilities include a state-of-the-art garage (for Automotive), kitchen (for Culinary), salon (for Cosmetology), and mock hospital (for Health Science). In 2010, these technologically advanced programs have earned Western the title of "Best School for Hands-on Education" by Baltimore Magazine.
