Tanza National Comprehensive High School (or ) is a public high school located at Daang Amaya II, Tanza, Cavite, Philippines. TNCHS or simply Tanza High was established in 1949. ==Visions== To provide quality basic education for the young citizens of Tanza and preparing them to be responsible, self-sufficient, globally competitive and God-fearing individuals. ==History== Long years ago, the demand for a secondary school in Tanza, Cavite was imperative for the people because, in the province of Cavite, only Cavite High School in the north and Indang Rural High School in the south existed. It was a dilemma for the high school students from Tanza, especially those coming from barrios and neighboring towns, to commute from their place to the city, which was a distance of 25 kilometers. And so, the civic-spirited citizens of Tanza worked hard to have a high school established in their place. November 5, 1949, the Tanza High School was opened, but all classes were held in rented buildings with rooms far below standards set forth by the bureau. There was no playground as the site was formerly rice land and health facilitated in adequate. But those problems were resolved when the school was fortunately chosen as the recipient of "pork barrel" allocation of Honorable Justiniano S. Montano. A school site of 40, 000 square meters was acquired and two-story main buildings with eight rooms and standard home economics buildings were constructed. October 27, 1952, Tanza High School was transferred to this site. Since then, the school's population began to grow every year. And to meet the demand of accommodation, the school constructed more buildings. During its early years of operation, Tanza High School offered a curriculum which was basically academic. The next years, the curriculum was changed to RSEP'73 in response to the needs of community and the New Society's educational reforms. With this academic and vocational subjects are given equal weight of importance. At the same time, Tanza High School which formerly subsisted on its income from tuition fees plus the aid from the municipal government was changed to Tanza National Comprehensive High School. Being comprehensive, the curriculum was with the addition of specialized courses and electives in the academic. And being a national high school, its subsistence is now provided by the national fund. ==Curriculum== Tanza National Comprehensive High School has 4 curriculums: * General Curriculum (BEC-Basic education curriculum) * Special Science Class (SSC) * Special Program for Journalism (SPJ) * Special Program in Foreign Language [Korean] (SPFL) ==Notable alumni== * Epimaco Velasco - former DILG Secretary and NBI Director ==References== ==External links== Category:High schools in Cavite
