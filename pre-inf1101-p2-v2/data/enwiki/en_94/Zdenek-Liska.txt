Zdenek Liska (16 March 1922 - 13 August 1983) was a Czech composer who produced a large number of film scores across a prolific career that started in the 1950s. He was revelatory in his contribution to the development of electronic music. His music in this field is noticeable and dramatic, based on a unique musical feeling achieved using quite unusual instrumental combinations and various electronic and electroacoustic techniques. == Biography == Zdenek Liska was born on 16 March 1922 in Smecno near Kladno in central Bohemia. His father and grandfather were amateur municipal musicians. As a child he learned to play the accordion and the violin; while in high school, he composed his first song. He studied composition and conducting at Prague Conservatory under Rudolf Karel, Otakar Sin, Metod Dolezil, and Karel Janecek. He graduated from the Conservatory in 1944. After a brief stint as a conductor of an amateur orchestra in Slany and as a teacher at a Humpolec music school, he joined the Zlin Film Studios in 1945. == Works == Liska worked notably with animator Jan Svankmajer, scoring several of his earlier short films: Punch and Judy (1966), Et Cetera (1966), Historia Naturae (Suita) (1967), The Flat (1968), Don Juan (1969), The Ossuary (1970), Jabberwocky (1971), and Leonardo's Diary (1972), and later The Castle of Otranto (1979). Liska's music for Svankmajer's Historia Naturae (Suita), The Flat, and The Ossuary was also featured in the 1984 short film by American animators the Brothers Quay entitled The Cabinet of Jan Svankmajer. He also created a great number of iconic scores for important live-action films of the Czech New Wave including The Shop on Main Street, Marketa Lazarova, The Valley of the Bees, Fruit of Paradise, The Cremator and Ikarie XB-1. Liska was the most sought after film composer in Czechoslovakia in the 1950s and 1960s. He scored eight films a year plus numerous shorts, during the 1960s.https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/music-by-zdenek-liska In addition to his feature-film work, Liska wrote music for the travel documentary films of Hanzelka and Zikmund, for Laterna Magika, for twelve of Karel Zeman's Mr. Prokouk films, and for various popular science short films. The main theme he wrote for the heavily propagandist television series Thirty Cases of Major Zeman is still widely remembered in the Czech Republic, where it is often played by rock bands. In the mid-twentieth century, he was among the most well-known Czech film composers and the foremost Czech composer of fantasy film scores. He was noted for his skill with musical characterizations and humor in music, as well as his creative use of electronic music techniques. He lived in the era of film symphonies but he loved experimenting too with popular rock music and electronic instruments.https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/music-by-zdenek-liska His score for Death Is Called Engelchen won a prize in a competition for the best Czechoslovak feature-length film score of 1963. == Selected filmography == {| class="wikitable sortable" |- !Year !Film |- | style="text-align:center;"|1950 | Para nad hrncem |- | style="text-align:center;"|1952 | Poklad Ptaciho ostrova |- | rowspan="2" style="text-align:center;"|1953 | Z Argentiny do Mexika |- | Afrika I, II |- | style="text-align:center;"|1956 | Micek Flicek |- | rowspan="2" style="text-align:center;"|1957 | Tam na konecne |- | Nove svety - selection of archive music |- | rowspan="2" style="text- align:center;"|1958 | Vynalez zkazy |- | Muz mnoha tvari |- | style="text- align:center;"|1959 | Probuzeni |- | rowspan="3" style="text- align:center;"|1960 | Higher Principle |- | The White Dove |- | Laterna magika II. |- | rowspan="4" style="text-align:center;"|1961 | The Fabulous Baron Munchausen |- | The Devil's Trap |- | Labyrint srdce |- | Spadla s mesice |- | style="text-align:center;"|1962 | Pulnocni mse |- | rowspan="4" style="text- align:center;"|1963 | Cesta hlubokym lesem |- | Tri zlate vlasy deda Vseveda |- | Ikarie XB-1 |- | Death Is Called Engelchen |- | rowspan="3" style="text- align:center;"|1964 | Cintamani a podvodnik |- | Obzalovany |- | Jak delat podobiznu ptaka |- | rowspan="2" style="text-align:center;"|1965 | The Shop on Main Street |- | Sberne surovosti |- | rowspan="3" style="text- align:center;"|1966 | Poklad byzantskeho kupce |- | Lide z maringotek |- | Andel blazene smrti |- | rowspan="4" style="text-align:center;"|1967 | Udoli vcel |- | Zmluva s diablom |- | Utek |- | Marketa Lazarova |- | rowspan="4" style="text-align:center;"|1968 | The Cremator |- | Maraton |- | Spravedlnost pro Selvina (TV) |- | The Sinful People of Prague (TV series) |- | rowspan="4" style="text-align:center;"|1969 | Adelheid |- | Birds, Orphans and Fools |- | Touha zvana Anada |- | Ovoce stromu rajskych jime |- | rowspan="2" style="text-align:center;"|1970 | Partie krasneho dragouna |- | Medena veza |- | rowspan="3" style="text-align:center;"|1971 | Smrt cerneho krale |- | Penicka a Paraplicko |- | Orlie pierko |- | rowspan="2" style="text- align:center;"|1972 | Vlak do stanice Nebe |- | Ukradena bitva |- | rowspan="2" style="text-align:center;"|1973 | The Legend of the Silver Fir |- | Hriech Katariny Padychovej |- | rowspan="3" style="text-align:center;"|1974 | Kto odchadza v dazdi |- | Posledni ples na roznovske plovarne |- | Jachyme, hod ho do stroje! |- | rowspan="2" style="text-align:center;"|1975 | Tak laska zacina |- | Nevesta s nejkrasnejsima ocima |- | rowspan="3" style="text- align:center;"|1976 | Smoke on the Potato Fields |- | Smrt mouchy |- | Odysseus a hvezdy |- | rowspan="6" style="text-align:center;"|1977 | Volani rodu |- | Na Velike rece |- | Osada Havranu |- | Shadows of a Hot Summer |- | Pribeh lasky a cti |- | Hodina pravdy |- | rowspan="3" style="text- align:center;"|1978 | Silnejsi nez strach |- | Cekani na dest |- | Setkani v cervenci |- | rowspan="2" style="text-align:center;"|1979 | A pobezim az na kraj sveta |- | Smrt sita na mieru |- | style="text-align:center;"|1980 | Signum laudis |- | style="text-align:center;"|1981 | Kam zmizel kuryr |- |} ==References== ==External links== * *Filmography at the Ceske filmove nebe *Zdenek Liska at the last.fm webpages *Zdenek Liska at the dmtls Merzbau *Facebook group for fans of Liska Category:1922 births Category:1983 deaths Category:People from Smecno Category:Czech composers Category:Czech male composers Category:Czech film score composers Category:20th-century composers Category:Male film score composers Category:20th-century male musicians
