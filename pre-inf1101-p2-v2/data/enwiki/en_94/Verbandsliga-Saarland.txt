The Verbandsliga Saarland is currently the seventh tier of the German football league system in the German federal state of Saarland. Until the introduction of the Saarlandliga in 2009 it was the sixth tier, until the introduction of the 3. Liga in 2008 it was the fifth tier of the league system, until the introduction of the Regionalligas in 1994 the fourth tier. From the 2012-13 season onwards the league will be played in two regional divisions and the Landesligas below it increased in numbers from two to four. ==Overview== The Verbandsliga was formed in 1947 under the name of Ehrenliga Saarland in the state of Saarland. The league was originally a feeder league to the Oberliga Sudwest. Due to the special situation of Saarland, its clubs left the German football league system from 1949 to 1951 with the 1. FC Saarbrucken playing a year in the French second division.France - List of Final Tables Second Level From its return in 1951, now under the name of Amateurliga Saarland, until the establishment of the Oberliga Sudwest in 1978, it was the third tier of the football league system. The league was established in 1947 with ten teams, the winner gaining promotion to the Oberliga Sudwest. The founder members were: *FC 08 Homburg *Sportfreunde Burbach *FC Ensdorf *SC Brebach *Preussen Merchweiler *FV Puttlingen *SV Ludweiler *ASC Dudweiler *SV Bliekastel *Hellas Marpingen *Viktoria Huhnerfeld With the return to the German league system in 1951, two teams from the league, now called Amateurliga Saarland were admitted to the Oberliga Sudwest, the 1. FC Saarbrucken and Borussia Neunkirchen. The year after, three clubs were admitted to the new 2nd Oberliga Sudwest, the Viktoria Huhnerfeld, SC Altenkessel und Sportfreunde Saarbrucken. The winner of the Amateurliga Saarland was not automatically promoted to its superior league but rather had to take part in a promotion play-off. The champion would have to compete with the winners of the Amateurligen Sudwest and Rheinland. With the introduction of the Bundesliga in 1963 the Amateurliga was placed below the new Regionalliga Sudwest but still retained its third-tier status. It continued to do so after the introduction of the 2nd Bundesliga Sud in 1974. In 1978, the same time as the Oberliga Sudwest, the Amateurliga Saarland was renamed Verbandsliga Saarland and was now the fourth tier of the league system. The top seven teams out of the Amateurliga went to the new Oberliga while the teams from place 8 to 19 found themselves in the Verbandsliga. The winner of the Verbandsliga Saarland, like the winners of the Verbandsligen Sudwest and Rheinland gains direct promotion to the Oberliga Sudwest. The runners-up will only get a chance for promotion when there are additional spots to fill in the Oberliga, like 1994 when the Regionalligen were introduced and VfB Dillingen was promoted. The Saarland was the youngest of the states of West Germany, until 1957 it was a separate entity under French supervision. Its football league was temporarily separate, too. The clubs from the Saar did not play in the German football league system from 1948 to 1951. Feeder Leagues to the Verbandsliga Saarland *Landesliga Saarland-Nord *Landesliga Saarland-Ost *Landesliga Saarland-Sud *Landesliga Saarland-West In May 2008, the Saarland Football Association decided to change the league system by introducing the new Saarlandliga as the sixth tier, between Oberliga and Verbandsliga, from 2009. For the Verbandsliga, this meant, it would lose almost all its clubs to the new league and be relegated to seventh tier. Otherwise, it remained unchanged. ==League winners== The league champions in the single division era: {| class="wikitable" |- align="center" bgcolor="#dfdfdf" !width="80"| Season !width="200"| Club |- |1947-48 |FC 08 Homburg |- |1948-49 |Borussia Neunkirchen |- |1949-50 |Sportfreunde Saarbrucken |- |1950-51 |1.
