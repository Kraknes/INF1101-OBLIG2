Kahekili II, full name Kahekilinui`ahumanu, (c. 1737-1794) was an ali'i (Mo`i) of Maui. His name was short for Kane-Hekili after the Hawaiian god of thunder. Because Kane-Hekili was believed to be black on one side, Kahekili tattooed one side of his body from head to foot. He was called Titeeree, King of Mowee by European explorers. == Family == He was born about 1710-1737 in Hali`imaile on the island of Maui. His father was Kekaulike Kalani-nui-Kui-Hono-i-Kamoku the 23rd Mo`i of Maui. His mother was Kekuaipoiwa-nui Kalani-kauhihiwakama Wanakapu (Kekuiapoiwa I, half-sister of Kekaulike). He had at least two wives, and three or four sons and two daughters. His sister was Kalola. There is a theory that he was the biological father of Kamehameha I, as Kamehameha I was told this and provided with proof of the same. == Battles == His kingdom won seven of the Hawaiian Islands except the Island of Hawai`i and paved the way for the creation of a unified Kingdom of Hawaii by Kamehameha I. He succeeded his brother Kamehameha-nui `Ailu`au as king of Maui, Lanai and Moloka`i in 1765. He conquered King Kahahana of O`ahu and killed most of the O`ahu chiefs that stood in his way, using their skeletons to construct a house of bones. This insurrection of the O`ahu chiefs is known as Waipi'o-Kimopo. He had influence on Kaua`i through his brother Kaeokulani who was the consort of Kamakahelei, Queen regnant of Kaua`i. After his death in Waikiki in July 1794, war broke out between his son Kalanikupule, King of O`ahu, and his brother Kaeokulani over succession to Kingdom of Maui. Kalanikupule eventually overcame his uncles on December 6, 1794. As Kalanikupule's forces were weakened it gave Kamehameha a chance to conquer Maui. The Kingdom of Maui would eventually fall after Kamehameha defeated the combined forces of O`ahu and Maui in the Battle of Nu`uanu on May 1, 1795 less than a year after Kahekili's death. == References == Category:1737 births Category:1794 deaths Category:Royalty of Maui Category:House of Kekaulike Category:House of Liloa Category:18th-century monarchs
