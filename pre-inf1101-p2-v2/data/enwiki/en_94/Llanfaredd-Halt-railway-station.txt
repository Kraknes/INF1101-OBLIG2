Llanfaredd Halt railway station was an unstaffed railway station opened by the Great Western Railway on 7 May 1934 on the old Mid-Wales line between Builth Wells railway station and Erwood railway station in Powys, Wales. The station consisted of a small wooden platform and shelter, on the eastern side of the single line. Rarely used, the station was demolished after its closure on 31 December 1962. At present, the trackbed is still present and the site of the station can still be found with difficulty though on private land. Nothing remains of any building. Not far away was a spur to the Builth Stone quarries. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1934 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1962 Category:Disused railway stations in Powys Category:Former Great Western Railway stations
