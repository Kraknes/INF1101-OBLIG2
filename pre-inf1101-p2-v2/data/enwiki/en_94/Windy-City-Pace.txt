The Windy City Pace was a harness race for 3-year-old Standardbred pacing horses. It had been run annually since 1983 at Maywood Park in Melrose Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. The race was originally run during Maywood's spring meet, but since 1991 the race has been run during the fall meet. In past years, elimination heats were required to determine the finalists for the main race. The race is the top race of a program that also features Mayood's other top stakes, the Abe Lincoln], the Galt, and the Cinderella. Among the notable runnings of the Windy City was the 1987 race, where Bomb Rickles won the final at odds of 190-1. ==Windy City Pace winners== {| class="wikitable sortable" |- ! style="background-color:#DACAA5; width:35px" | Year ! style="background-color:#DACAA5; width:120px"| Winner ! style="background-color:#DACAA5; width:130px"| Driver ! style="background-color:#DACAA5; width:45px"| Time |- | 1983 | Trim the Tree | Dick Macomber | 1:57 1/5 |- | 1984 | Carl's Bird | Carl E.
