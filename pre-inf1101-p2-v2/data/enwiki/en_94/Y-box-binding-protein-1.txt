Y box binding protein 1 also known as Y-box transcription factor or nuclease- sensitive element-binding protein 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the YBX1 gene. == Clinical significance == YBX1 is a potential drug target in cancer therapy. YB-1 helps the replication of adenovirus type 5, a commonly used vector in gene therapy. Thus, YB-1 can cause an "oncolytic" effect in YB-1 positive cancer cells treated with adenoviruses. == Interactions == Y box binding protein 1 has been shown to interact with: * ANKRD2, * CTCF, * P53, * PCNA, * RBBP6, and * SFRS9. == References == == Further reading == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * == External links == * Category:Transcription factors
