"I Feel a Song (In My Heart)" is a song recorded by Gladys Knight & the Pips. From the album I Feel a Song, the single spent two weeks at number one on the Hot Soul Singles chart in late 1974. It also peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. The original version of this song was recorded by Sandra Richardson in 1971, and subsequently by Linda Carr as well as the Stairsteps (whose lyrics were more spiritual), all of whom, like Gladys, recorded for the Buddah label,. The version by Gladys Knight and the Pips, which was faithful to the original interpretation, was therefore the fourth outing for the song. It was later recorded by both The Persuasions and Bob James. It was later sampled by Darkchild for Megan Rochell's song "Heartbreak". ==Chart positions== {|class="wikitable" !Chart (1974) !Peak position |- |U.S. Billboard Hot 100 |align="center"|21 |- |U.S. Billboard Hot Soul Singles |align="center"|1 |- |} ==References== ==External links== *[ Song Review] on Allmusic * Category:1974 singles Category:Gladys Knight & the Pips songs Category:Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs number-one singles Category:1974 songs Category:Buddah Records singles Category:Songs written by Tony Camillo
