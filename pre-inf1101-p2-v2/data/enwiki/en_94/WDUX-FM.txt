Its FM side, 92.7 WDUX-FM began broadcasting in January 1967. WDUX used the moniker, "Mid-Wisconsin's Hit Music Station." In the early part of the 1980s, it also featured a locally produced jazz show Sunday nights. At the beginning, the station ran an automated easy listening format, then simulcasted the AM, but in 1987, the AM side began broadcasting an automated country music format, using the monikers "Real Country AM 800 WDUX", & "DUX 'ducks' Country AM 800", while the FM side continued its contemporary music format. Until May 12, 2020, "FM 92.7" used live & local personalities, opposed to syndicated satellite programming, using Voice Tracking some evening and weekend hours, The FM also carries local sports broadcasts, along with Green Bay Packer Football, Milwaukee Brewer Baseball, Milwaukee Bucks Basketball, and Badger Football and Basketball.
