The Grinda Brothers were the official organ-builders to the King of Sardinia in the 18th century. * Honore Grinda (30 September 1754 in Nice - 15 June 1843 in Prats-de-Mollo) first learned carpentry with his grandfather, then became an apprentice under Jean-Esprit Isnard, a Dominican from Tarascon near Avignon, himself a noted organ-builder. In 1779, he learned the trade of pipe fitter in Toulouse with Gregoire Rabini. * Antoine Grinda (1775 in Nice - 8 July 1835 in Perpignan), a younger brother of the former.
