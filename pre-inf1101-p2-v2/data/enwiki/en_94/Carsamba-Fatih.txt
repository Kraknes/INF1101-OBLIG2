Carsamba is a small part of Balat quarter of Istanbul, Turkey. It is in Fatih, the capital district which hosts the provincial authorities, inside the walls of the ancient Byzantine city of Constantinople. It is one of the most conservative areas of the city, and also a quite peaceful environment. It is rich with Byzantine monuments, like the mosques of Fethiye and Hirami Ahmet Pasha. According to 17th-century Ottoman traveler Evliya Celebi, its name comes from the town of Carsamba in the Black Sea Region since, after the Fall of Constantinople, this part of Istanbul was repopulated with people coming from that city. Mamboury, (1953), p.99 In Turkish Carsamba means "Wednesday" and a famous street market is organized every week on this day, the Carsamba Pazari ("Carsamba Market", but also "Wednesday Market"). ==Notes== ==Sources== * Category:Quarters of Fatih
