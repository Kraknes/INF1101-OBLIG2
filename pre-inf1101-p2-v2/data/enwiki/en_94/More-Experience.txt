More Experience is the second live album that was issued of the performance by the Jimi Hendrix Experience at the Royal Albert Hall in London on February 24, 1969. Released in March 1972 in the United Kingdom by Ember Records, it was promoted as a soundtrack to a film documenting the performance. However, legal difficulties have prevented release of the film and the complete soundtrack. Accompanied by incorrect liner notes, it features two highly edited recordings that appeared on the previous Ember release, Experience, plus two tracks that had been already released on Hendrix in the West (1972), and three others. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== The Jimi Hendrix Experience * Jimi Hendrixguitar, vocals * Mitch Mitchelldrums * Noel Reddingbass guitar Additional musicians on "Room Full of Mirrors" * Chris Woodflute * Dave Masonguitar ==References== Category:Live albums published posthumously Category:Jimi Hendrix live albums Category:1972 live albums Category:Live albums recorded at the Royal Albert Hall
