Huron-Kinloss is a township in the Canadian province of Ontario, located within Bruce County. The township had a population of 7,069 in the Canada 2016 Census. Huron-Kinloss is located in Western Ontario, on Lake Huron. It is relatively remote, particularly by the standards of densely populated Southern Ontario and remains a primarily rural region of farmland and woodlots. The lake shore is sparsely populated with the village of Point Clark at the south end and Boiler Beach at the north end, with a mixture of seasonal and permanent cottages along the shore in between. Lucknow and Ripley are the largest towns inland. Economically, the township depends heavily on agriculture and agricultural services, and some food processing such as the Pine River cheese factory. A number of residents work in Kincardine or Goderich, with the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station being the largest employer in the area. Tourism is also economically prominent. With tourism and the Bruce plant, the local economy is more prosperous than many similar regions. The Town of Ripley, in Huron-Kinloss is home to the Bruce Botanical Food Gardens. This public garden is the first of its kind in Canada using tourism to address the issues of food insecurity, sustainable agriculture and the plight of the small family farm. The non-profit organization is focused on rare, endangered, heirloom, and ethnocultural food plants and showcases over 250 varieties with over 10,000 plants overall in the Phase One development. The region is popular with retirees, with a lake-moderated mild climate and a reputation for a relaxed, friendly lifestyle. The boiler from the Erie Belle explosion lies on Boiler Beach at the northern end of the township. ==Communities== The township comprises the communities of Amberley, Bruce Beach, Blair's Grove, Clarks Church, Clover Valley, Holyrood, Kinlough, Langside, Lower Langside, Lucknow, Lurgan Beach, Pine River, Point Clark, Purple Grove, Reid's Corners, Ripley, Verdun, and Whitechurch.
