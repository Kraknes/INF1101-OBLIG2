Osney Rail Bridge is a railway bridge over the River Thames at Oxford in England. It carries the Cherwell Valley Line between Didcot and Oxford across the river on the reach between Iffley Lock and Osney Lock. The original bridge was built in 1850, when the Great Western Railway built a new line from its original Oxford station at Grandpont to Rugby. The north side of the bridge was on the island which was then called Osney. A second bridge was built in 1887 within a foot or so of the first bridge.Where Thames Smooth Waters Glide: Osney Railway Bridge, UK.
