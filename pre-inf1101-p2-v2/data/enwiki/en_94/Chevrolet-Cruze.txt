The Chevrolet Cruze is a compact car that has been made by the Chevrolet division of General Motors since 2008. The nameplate has been used previously in Japan, for a version of a subcompact hatchback car produced under a joint venture with Suzuki from 2001 to 2007, and was based on the Suzuki Ignis. Since 2009, the Cruze nameplate has designated a globally developed, designed, and manufactured four-door compact sedan--complemented by a five-door hatchback body variant (in 2010 it also replaced the Chevrolet Cobalt) from 2011, and a station wagon in 2012. The Cruze was actually released earlier in 2008 to the South Korean market under the name Daewoo Lacetti Premiere until the phasing out of the Daewoo brand in favor of Chevrolet in 2011. In , the model has been on sale since 2009 as the Holden Cruze. This new generation Cruze does not serve as a replacement for the Suzuki-derived Japanese market predecessor. Instead, it replaces three other compact models: the Chevrolet Optra sold internationally under various names (such as the Suzuki Forenza in the United States, Chevrolet Optra in Latin America and Canada, Chevrolet/Daewoo Lacetti in Europe and Asia), the Chevrolet Cobalt, sold exclusively in North America, and the Opel-sourced, -market Holden Astra (later returning in 2012 briefly as an Opel until the next year, and again in 2015 as a Holden). While production of the Cruze in the United States and Mexico ended in 2019, the car is still produced and sold in other markets worldwide. __TOC__ == Nameplate disambiguation == 2001-2008 Chevrolet Cruze 2001-2008 Chevrolet Cruze Before the release of the global Chevrolet Cruze compact sedan in 2008, General Motors made use of the name "Cruze" between 2001 and 2008 in Japan. Announced as the Chevrolet YGM1 concept car at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1999, the original Cruze was derived from the subcompact Suzuki Ignis five-door hatchback (known as the Suzuki Swift in Japan). Despite the Chevrolet branding, the YGM1, like the production car, was the work of GM's Australian arm, Holden. Along with the styling, Holden executed most of the engineering work and were responsible for devising the "Cruze" nameplate. The Cruze came either with a 1.3- or 1.5-liter engine coupled to either five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmissions. Manufactured by Suzuki in Japan, GM revealed the production Chevrolet Cruze in October 2001, with Japanese sales commencing the following month. From 2002 through to 2006 this generation of Cruze was sold in Australia and New Zealand. In New Zealand this generation Cruze was sold as the Chevrolet Cruze. The production Cruze had standard front-wheel drive, with all-wheel drive optional. Chevrolet pursued a marketing strategy that positioned the high-riding Cruze as a light-duty sport utility vehicle (SUV). This contrasted with Suzuki's approach with the Ignis marketed as a conventional passenger model. From 2003, Suzuki of Europe began manufacturing the Cruze as the Suzuki Ignis--representing a facelift of the original Ignis, but only for European markets. == First generation (J300; 2008) == In 2008, GM introduced the Cruze compact car, carrying the "J300" internal designation. This J300 iteration serves as a replacement for the Chevrolet Cobalt, Daewoo Lacetti and Holden Astra--all unrelated cars. GM phased out production of the Cobalt and its badge engineered counterpart, the Pontiac G5 in 2010, just prior to the manufacturing of the Chevrolet Cruze was to commence. The first renderings of the Cruze were revealed by GM at a press conference on July 15, 2008, with the first official images released on August 21, 2008. Cruze production sites include Gunsan, Jeonbuk, South Korea; Saint Petersburg, Russia; Shenyang, China; and Halol, India; Hanoi, Vietnam since April 2010 in complete knock-down (CKD) form, Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan from May 2010; Rayong, Thailand after December 2010, and Sao Caetano do Sul, Brazil from 2011. Holden's localized hatchback version of the Cruze built at the Elizabeth, South Australia factory from late 2011 joined the Cruze sedan manufactured there since March 2011. GM in the United States has upgraded the existing plant in Lordstown, Ohio to manufacture the Cruze, investing more than . At the ceremony of the start of production of Cruze at Ohio, Mark Reuss, the president of GM's North American operations said, "This is everything for us". It is described as GM's most significant new vehicle introduction into North America since the Chapter 11 reorganization in 2009, and is GM's latest attempt to build a small size car that North American consumers would "buy because they like it - not simply because it is cheap". Underpinned by the front-wheel drive GM Delta II platform, GM has confirmed the Cruze development program occurred under a global design and engineering team. GM Daewoo in South Korea played a leading role in the design and engineering of the Cruze, along with GM's German-based Opel division. This development program spanned over 27 months at a cost of US$4 billion. A total of 221 prototypes were tested in Australia, Canada, China, South Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. According to GM, the Cruze's body structure is 65 percent high-strength steel. MacPherson struts are utilized in the front suspension with a solid torsion beam axle for the rear, avoiding the cost and complexity needed for a modern multi-link independent rear suspension used by some more expensive rivals. According to GM's global product development chief Mark Reuss, the North America version Cruze is modified from the global platform as it requires reinforcements to the engine compartment because it offers a bigger engine than in other markets and uses torsion beam suspension. Hydraulically-assisted (electric for North American market) rack and pinion steering gives for a turning circle. Braking-wise, ventilated front, and solid rear disc brakes are employed, both using piston steel calipers. To counteract noise, vibration, and harshness, engineers have designed the Cruze with an isolated four-point engine mount and implemented sound damping material in areas including the front-of-dashboard panel, luggage compartment, decklid internals, doors, carpet and headlining. Further noise suppression through the use of a triple-layer sealing system in the doors has also been employed. A five-door Cruze hatchback was unveiled as a concept car at the 2010 Paris Motor Show on October 1, 2010. Cruze hatchback sales began in Europe in mid-2011. Holden in Australia were responsible for the design and development of the hatchback body variant. GM unveiled the Chevrolet Cruze station wagon in February 2012 at the Geneva Motor Show. Load space ranges from about up to the window line in the rear, to nearly up to the roof top with the rear seats folded down. === Safety === The Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) in May 2009 awarded the Cruze five out of five stars in their crash safety test, with 35.04 out of a possible 37 points. The following July, the China New Car Assessment Program (C-NCAP) awarded the Cruze five out of five stars in their test. The Cruze SE 1.6-liter tested scored 16 points in side-impact collision, 14.44 in front-end collision, and 15.73 in the 40 percent frontal offset collision. Euro NCAP graded the Cruze at five out of five stars as well--96 percent for adult protection, and 84 percent for child occupant protection, though the rating for pedestrian protection was a much lower 34 percent. The South Korean-specification Cruze--the Daewoo Lacetti Premiere--received the top rating of five stars in the Korean New Car Assessment Program's (KNCAP) frontal, offset frontal, side, and whiplash tests. In the United States, the Cruze received the highest possible ratings of "good" in front, side, rear and rollover crash protection tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), who listed the Cruze as a 2011 Top Safety Pick. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) gave the Cruze the agency's highest five-star safety rating, based on its score for frontal impact (driver and passenger), side impact (driver and passenger), and for the side pole test (driver). NHTSA graded the Cruze at four out of five stars for rollover safety performance. === Reliability and recalls === According to Consumer Reports, during its first year, the Cruze scored the lowest in reliability among compact sedans. GM announced in April 2011 that 2,100 Cruzes in North America would be recalled following a report of the steering wheel breaking away from the steering column during motion. On June 22, 2012, GM issued a recall for 413,418 Cruzes manufactured at the Lordstown, Ohio plant, to address a risk of engine compartment fires. The recall covered 2011 and 2012 models built from September 2010 through May 2012 and affected vehicles sold in the United States, Canada, and Israel. The fire hazard arose from the possibility of fluids becoming trapped near the engine and catching fire. 9,547 Australian- built Cruzes were also recalled for this reason, though no engine fires were reported in Australia. GM issued another recall on August 16, 2013 for 2011 and 2012-model Cruzes--292,879 cars built at the Lordstown plant--to address a potential loss of power brake assist, due to a faulty microswitch in the power brake vacuum pipe assembly of Cruzes with the 1.4-liter engine and the 6T40 automatic transaxle. GM stated awareness of 27 low-speed crashes due to brake issues that might have involved this fault. On March 28, 2014, GM halted sales of 2013- and 2014-model Cruzes with 1.4-liter engines (about 60% of Cruzes), initially without stating a reason for the stop-sale order;subsequently GM disclosed that the issue was a faulty right-side axle shaft. === 2012 update === The Cruze was given a mild facelift for 2013, unveiled at the 2012 Busan Motor Show in South Korea. There was a new front fascia with redesigned air vents around the fog lamps, and the grille and headlamps also received minor updates. New alloy wheels were offered, and GM's optional MyLink entertainment system became available. This model was first sold in Korea, then Malaysia, then in other markets.

All three engines are coupled to a five-speed manual or optional six-speed automatic transmission featuring Active Select. When the Cruze launched in the United States in 2010, a new 1.4-liter Family 0 turbocharged gasoline engine was introduced. North American models fitted with the 1.8-liter gasoline engine have also been upgraded to a standard six-speed manual. In 2011, a new 2.0-liter Family Z diesel engine marketed as VCDi replaced the previous VM Motori VCDi unit of equal displacement. Since late 2011, Chinese market models have been available with a turbocharged 1.6-liter engine with a six-speed manual transmission. {| class="wikitable" style = "font-size:90%" |- ! colspan = "5;" style = "background:#e8e8e8;" | Gasoline |- ! style = "background:#e8e8e8;" | Engine ! style = "background:#e8e8e8;" | Power ! style = "background:#e8e8e8;" | Torque ! style = "background:#e8e8e8;" | Transmission ! style = "background:#e8e8e8;" | Years |- | rowspan = "2" | Ecotec I4 (t/c) | rowspan = "2" | | (AU/EU) | rowspan = "2" | * 6-speed manual * 6-speed GM 6T40 automatic | 2010- |- | (NA) | 2010- |- | Ecotec I4 | | | * 5-speed manual * 6-speed GM 6T40 automatic | 2008- |- | Ecotec I4 (t/c) | | | * 6-speed manual | 2011- |- | rowspan = "2" | Ecotec I4 | (AU/EU) | (AU/EU) | rowspan = "2" | * 5-speed manual * 6-speed manual * 6-speed GM 6T30 automatic * 6-speed GM 6T40 automatic | 2008- |- | (NA) | (NA) | 2010- |- ! colspan = "5;" style = "background:#e8e8e8;" | Diesel |- ! style = "background:#e8e8e8;" | Engine ! style = "background:#e8e8e8;" | Power ! style = "background:#e8e8e8;" | Torque ! style = "background:#e8e8e8;" | Transmission ! style = "background:#e8e8e8;" | Years |- | rowspan=1 | VCDi (GM) I4 (t/c) | (EU) | (EU) | * 6-speed manual | 2012- |- | VCDi (VM Motori) I4 (t/c) | | | rowspan = "2" | * 5-speed manual * 6-speed M32 manual * 6-speed GM F40 manual * 6-speed GM 6T45 automatic | 2008-2011 |- | VCDi (GM) I4 (t/c) | (AU/EU) | (AU/EU) | 2011- |- | LUZ (GM/Fiat) I4 (t/c) | (NA) | (NA) | * 6-speed Aisin- Warner AF40-6 automatic | 2014- |- |} === Marketing === ;Africa The Chevrolet Cruze was launched in the Egyptian market during mid-2009. South African sales of the Cruze commenced in September 2009. ;Asia Daewoo Lacetti Premiere CDX sedan (Vietnam) South Korean-market versions of the Cruze entered production there in 2008 as the "Daewoo Lacetti Premiere". The Lacetti debuted on October 30, 2008, featuring the 1.6-liter naturally aspirated engine. On January 30, 2009, GM Daewoo introduced the turbodiesel engine variant. Inline with the February 2011 renaming of "GM Daewoo" to "GM Korea", the Lacetti Premiere adopted the international "Chevrolet Cruze" name from March 2, 2011. For the owners of the previous model, Lacetti, GM Korea decided to replace the old emblem to that of Chevrolet for free. The Chevrolet Cruze was launched in the Chinese market on April 18, 2009 as a sedan manufactured at GM India's Halol factory. Transmission choices were a five-speed manual or a six-speed automatic along with 1.6- or 1.8-liter engines. The sedan range consisted of the 1.6 SL, 1.6 SE, 1.8 SE (automatic only) and 1.8 SX (automatic only). Hatchback models were introduced in 2013 available with the 1.6-liter or 1.6-liter turbo engines. The Chevrolet Cruze was released in India on October 12, 2009. It was offered in only two versions: LT and LTZ in diesel form only (VCDi). During 2009, there were reports that the Cruze was to become available in Malaysia with the 1.6 and a 1.8-liter engines. The Naza automotive group in Malaysia has announced that it's expecting to launch the Cruze in the Malaysian market for the first time in the second quarter of 2010 and they are expecting to sell 1,200 to 1,500 units in 2010. In Thailand, the car launch in December 2010, built at GM's Rayong facility. Specification levels comprised: Base (1.6-liter), LS (1.6- and 1.8-liter), LT and LTZ (1.8-liter), 6-speed automatic are standard in all models except 1.6 Base used 5-speed manual, with an optional 2.0-liter VCDi available on LTZ variant with 6-speed automatic. ; The Australian arm of GM, Holden, announced at the Melbourne International Motor Show on February 27, 2009 that sales of the South Korean-produced Cruze would begin under the Holden brand. Replacing the Holden Viva, the Cruze reached dealerships on June 1. The Cruze also became the replacement for the Holden Astra, dropped from the Holden lineup the following August. Given the model designation JG, the Holden Cruze was launched with the 1.8-liter petrol engine and optional 2.0-liter turbodiesel. Both engines are mated to the five- speed manual transmission or optional six-speed automatic. Electronic stability control (ESC), seat belt pretensioners and six airbags were standard fitment across the range. Specification-wise, the "CD" opened up the range, finished off with a more upmarket "CDX". The "CD" equipment list comprised 16-inch steel wheels, air conditioning, cruise control, a trip computer, power windows and automatic headlamps. "CDX" versions add 17-inch alloy wheels, front fog lamps, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and upholstery, heated front seats and rear parking sensors. Initially a petrol-only model, diesel availability was expanded to the "CDX" trim in early 2010. On March 18, 2010, Holden issued a recall for 9,098 petrol-engined 2010 model year Cruzes in Australia and a further 485 in New Zealand over a faulty fuel hose. According to Holden, some hoses on 1.8-liter cars had developed a leakage, although no accidents or injuries had been reported prior to the recall. The recall followed a stop-delivery notice issued by Holden to its dealers on March 3 while the automaker conducted an investigation into the matter. Holden announced on December 22, 2008 that its Elizabeth, South Australia production line would be split to commence local production of the Cruze sedan and the Australian-developed hatchback. Production was originally scheduled to start by September 2010. However, it was confirmed in January 2010 that production would in fact begin in March 2011. The announcement to assemble the car came as a response to the slowing sales of the larger, locally produced Holden Commodore range. The Australian Government committed 149 million to the program from its $6.2 billion Green Car Innovation Fund, with a further $30 million given by the State Government of South Australia. GM Holden matched both amounts, but the then chairman and managing director Mark Reuss would not reveal Holden's total investment. Reuss announced his firm would be considering the utilization of liquid petroleum gas (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG), ethanol (E85) flexible-fuel and petrol/electric hybrid start-stop system powertrain technologies. These technologies, if materialized, would supplement the four-cylinder petrol and diesel powertrain offerings already confirmed by Holden at the time of the announcement. At a media event on February 28, 2011, Holden unveiled the Australian assembled Cruze sedan in facelifted "Series II" guise, otherwise known as the JH series. Prime Minister Julia Gillard attended the February launch to drive the first example off Holden's production line before full-scale production commenced in March. Holden has confirmed an initial local content level of between 40 and 50 percent if assessed by retail value, with an aim of increasing Cruze localization over time. Series II styling revisions to the grille, lower air intake, and bumper have softened the front-end to bear a closer resemblance to Holden's larger VE II Commodore. Further differentiation from the original has been achieved via the fitment of amber front indicator lights, jewelled bezel headlamps, remodelled wheel trims, and through adjustments to the lower portion of the rear bumper. Carrying over largely unchanged is the 1.8-liter petrol inline-four, tweaked to yield slight enhancements in drivability. When automatic transmission is specified, the 1.8-liter is now teamed with GM's six-speed 6T30 unit, lighter and more compact than the previous 6T40. Diesel remains optional for "CD" and "CDX" specifications over the standard 1.8-liter petrol. Alterations to the 2.0-liter turbodiesel have resulted in an additional and and a slight reduction in fuel consumption for the manual variant, now a six-speed unit. However, the headline change is the release of the turbocharged 1.4-liter engine, dubbed iTi by Holden for intelligent turbo induction. The inclusion of the 1.4 also brings an upgrade to electric (as opposed to hydraulic) power steering and affixes a Watt's linkage to the torsion beam rear suspension. Linked with six-speed manual or automatic transmissions, the 1.4 is fitted as standard to the new "SRi" and "SRi-V" sports-oriented trims, but is available at extra cost on the base "CD". The new "SRi" and "SRi-V" models have their respective badges embossed onto the grille insert, are fitted with their own front bumper design, and feature side skirts, chrome exterior door handles, a rear lip spoiler, and five-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels. Over the "CD", "SRi" gains a leather-covered steering wheel rim and shift lever, with the "SRi-V" extending this upholstering to the seating. A heat function for the front seats, keyless entry with push-button engine start, reversing sensors, and seven-inch LCD multimedia unit are also part of the "SRi-V" equipment list. This multimedia system integrates satellite navigation, the CD and DVD players, and a 10 GB internal hard disk drive. In mid-November 2011, Holden released the MY12 update to the Series II Cruze. This update coincided with the release of the hatchback body variant and saw Bluetooth telephone connectivity standard across the range. In April 2013 the Series II Cruze received an update and price drops. The update included rear-parking sensors, a 7-inch touch-screen, suspension adjustments and improved automatic gearboxes across the range along with many other new extras such as a larger 1.6-liter turbocharged engine as standard on the SRi and SRi-V, replacing the 1.4-liter turbo. Holden ended manufacturing of the Cruze at its Elizabeth plant on October 7, 2016, replaced by the Astra hatchback and new generation Cruze sedan--both imported. ;Europe European specification variants of the Cruze are offered with 1.6- and 1.8-litre petrol engines, and 2.0-litre and (from 2012) 1.7-litre diesel engines. In mid-2011, with the arrival of the five-door hatchback variant, the 1.6-litre petrol engine received an upgrade from 113 bhp to 122 bhp. Exports from the South Korean factory began on February 24, 2009. ;North America Mexico became the first North American country to receive the car, going on sale for the 2010 model year in late 2009. Imported from South Korea, the Chevrolet Cruze in Mexico replaces both the Chevrolet Astra (last sold in 2008) and Optra as the compact offering there. The US and Canadian version of the Chevrolet Cruze entered limited production at Lordstown, Ohio, in July 2010 as a 2011 model, replacing the Chevrolet Cobalt. Full production began September 8, 2010. For these markets, the Cruze utilizes a more advanced Watts Z-link rear suspension from the Opel Astra (J). Offered in LS, LT, LTZ, and Eco trim lines, both the 1.8-liter and the turbocharged 1.4-liter engines are offered, coupled with either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. With a starting price slightly higher than most compact competitors, the base model Cruze LS is equipped with the 1.8-liter gasoline engine and comes with air-conditioning and power locks, the higher-level LT and LTZ models is fitted with the 1.4-liter turbocharged gasoline engine. For the Eco model, aerodynamic improvements have been made such as an electronically controlled air shutter that adjusts air flow to the engine depending on the temperature, wind speed and tow weight. To save weight, Chevrolet replaces the space saving spare tire and jack on the Eco model with a tire inflator kit, reducing weight by . Standard safety equipment includes electronic stability control and ten airbags, including side rear-seat and front knee airbags not fitted on models produced in the original South Korea facility. The Cobalt's badge engineered twin, the Pontiac G5, has not been replaced by a Cruze-based equivalent, due to the Pontiac brand being phased out during 2010. The Cruze is built on the production lines that were used to build the Cobalt and Pontiac G5 in Lordstown, Ohio. Cobalt production ended in June 2010 and the Cruze started production in July 2010. GM has allocated three shifts to produce the Cruze and it arrived to dealers in September 2010, giving all dealers time to deplete their inventories of Cobalts. Changes to the North American-built Cruze for model year 2012 include the availability of the six-speed manual transmission for the 1.4-litre turbocharged engine, plus models not equipped with power front seats no longer have the front seat cushion tilt option. Starting with the 2014 model year, Chevrolet offered the Cruze with the clean diesel engine option for North America. With a starting price of $25,695, the Cruze diesel 2.0-liter Multijet engine got 44 mpg on the highway and 27 mpg in the city, while producing and , mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. The 2014 Chevy Cruze Clean Turbo Diesel, direct from the factory, will be rated for up to B20 (blend of 20% biodiesel / 80% regular diesel) biodiesel compatibility. The Cruze diesel was the first GM passenger car in the US equipped with a diesel engine in 28 years, however sales were weaker than expected with 2% of US models. For 2016, the first generation Cruze continued as a fleet and rental exclusive model in the United States, billed as Cruze Limited. The diesel model was discontinued, but a new chrome appearance package was offered."Chevy Repurposes First Gen Cruze as Cruze Limited For Fleet Customers" from GM Authority (June 24, 2015) === Trim levels (North America) === Between 2011 and 2016, the first-generation Chevrolet Cruze was available in several different trim levels: L : The L, introduced in 2015, was positioned below the previously-base LS.

Based on the D2XX platform and designed by SAIC- GM, the Cruze J400 CN only sold for 2 years before the release of the international Cruze J400. The four-door sedan has a fastback-like sloping roofline and a low drag coefficient of 0.28 comes with a choice of a turbocharged direct injection engine with a power of at 5,600 rpm and torque of at 1,600-4,000 rpm, which can be mated with a six-speed manual transmission or seven-speed Start/Stop enabled dual-clutch gearbox, or a direct injection engine with a power of at 5,600 rpm and torque of at 6,000 rpm mated to a six- speed Start/Stop-capable automatic transmission. Both engines come from the new GM Small Gasoline Engine family. Weight reduction of 10% is achieved by using very high-strength steels and aluminum alloys. Watt's link torsion beam rear suspension, first used on the Opel Astra (J), comes as standard. The car comes equipped with a 4.2" color screen radio or MyLink 2.0 infotainment system with an 8" screen, and can be configured with OnStar Gen10 offering 4G LTE Internet connection with a built-in Wi-Fi hotspot. === International version (2016-present, D2LC/D2LC-K) === Chevrolet Cruze hatchback Chevrolet Cruze sedan The second-generation Cruze began sales in North America in early 2016, delayed a year by engineering changes. The Cruze has a new external design with a new split grille front and a fastback-like sloping roofline from the Chinese version of the fastback. This second generation Cruze has a slightly longer length and wheelbase than the one designed for the Chinese market, with different styling cues. It is also powered by the 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing and torque. The 2016 Cruze comes equipped with both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto Capability features. However, only one of their phone brands at any one time can be used."Apple CarPlay's coming to these 14 Chevrolet cars in the 2016 model year" from PC World (May 27, 2015)"These are the 14 Chevrolet cars from the 2016 model year that will have Android Auto" from PC World (May 27, 2015) In January 2016, Chevrolet unveiled the five-door hatchback version of the North American Cruze at the North American International Auto Show. It went on sale in late 2016 as a 2017 model. Trim levels continue to be L, LS, LT (now combined into one trim level, as opposed to the previous 1LT and 2LT designations), and Premier (replacing the previous LTZ trim level as the top-of-the-line Cruze trim level). Discontinued are the Eco and Diesel trim levels (at least for the time being). All trim levels include a seven-inch MyLink touch-screen infotainment system with A/M-F/M radio, USB integration, a 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack, optional SiriusXM satellite radio, voice control, and CarPlay and Android Auto capabilities, keyless entry, power windows, power door locks, OnStar with 4G/LTE/Wi-Fi Hotspot connectivity for multiple devices and RemoteLink via an app on the consumer's smartphone, air conditioning, and a 1.4-liter EcoTec inline-four engine. Higher trim levels (LT and Premier) also offer features such as the "RS Sport Package", alloy wheels, remote start, keyless access with push-button ignition, a premium sound system by Bose with external amplifier and subwoofer, an eight-inch MyLink infotainment system with GPS navigation, a power tilt-and-sliding sunroof, and power seats. However, only the top-of-the-line Premier trim level offers heated leather seating surfaces, premium alloy wheels, and other luxury features. The base L only offers a six-speed manual transmission, while the Premier, on the other end of the spectrum, offers only a six-speed automatic transmission. The LS and LT trim levels offer either a six-speed manual transmission, or a six- speed automatic transmission. A new diesel-powered Cruze became available in 2017. It had the 1.6L turbodiesel also found in the 2018 Equinox, paired to either a nine-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmission. ===Australia=== Holden Astra Sedan Before launching the Chevrolet Cruze as the Holden Astra in Australia, Holden engineers performed 100,000 kilometres of suspension and steering testing at the Lang Lang Proving Ground south east of Melbourne, Australia, tuning for Australian roads. A firmer more compliant ride and more responsive steering tune is the result. Other major changes over the international model included revised front and rear bumpers, which aim to give it a similar look to the Holden Astra Hatch. Unlike the Hatch, the sedan is offered in LS, LS+, LT and LTZ trim levels. All models are powered by a turbocharged direct injection engine with a power of at 5,600 rpm and torque of at 1,600-4,000 rpm mated to a 6 speed manual or 6-speed automatic. === 2019 facelift === left Hatchback rear three-quarter view For 2019, the Cruze received a mid-cycle facelift, which made its debut in April 2018, along with restyled versions of the 2019 Camaro, Spark and Malibu. Changes for the Cruze for 2019 include the addition of a lower-priced LS model for the Cruze Hatchback, the deletion of the six-speed manual transmission option (all Cruze models, including the previous manual-only L, will come equipped with an automatic transmission), all-new third-generation MyLink Systems, and a revised RS Package for LT and Premier models. The 2019 Cruze went on sale in November 2018. === Discontinuation === Production of the D2LC-K Cruze ended in South Korea in July 2018, and in the US and Mexico in March 2019. The Lordstown assembly plant was closed and sold to Lordstown Motors, while Ramos Arizpe Assembly will build the Chevrolet Blazer instead. Production of the Cruze will continue in Argentina and China. Assembly of the Chevrolet Cruze Sedan at Lordstown Assembly in Lordstown, Ohio concluded on Wednesday, March 6, 2019, when the last car rolled off of the assembly line. Assembly plant workers at the plant wrote inspiring messages on the unfinished body underneath the paint, as well as signed one of the foam front seat cushions underneath the upholstery. GM turned down an offer from Cleveland automotive dealer owner Bernie Moreno to keep the plant open and continue building the Cruze under a five-year deal, which he hoped would be used to launch a ridesharing service featuring a fleet of Cruzes with two shifts under Moreno's direction. "Did GM nix huge deal for Cruzes?" from The Vindicator (Youngstown, Ohio) (March 18, 2019) Production in China ended in February 2020, following stronger sales of the Chevrolet Monza in that market.https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/02/gm-ends-production-of-the- chevrolet-cruze-in-china/ This leaves Argentina as the sole remaining producer of the Cruze, for the Latin American market. Unlike its Chevrolet predecessors for the U.S. market--Cavalier, Prizm, and Cobalt--or its Daewoo predecessors for the South Korean market--Espero, Nexia, Nubira, and Lacetti--the Cruze has been discontinued without any announcement or plans for a replacement. == Motorsport == The three works Chevrolet Cruze touring cars competing in the 2011 World Touring Car Championship The Chevrolet Cruze first entered the World Touring Car Championship in 2009 with a 2.0-litre naturally aspirated engine, taking six wins in its debut season. The car has proved successful since its entry, with Yvan Muller winning the championship in 2010 and again in 2011 using the new 1.6-litre turbocharged engine. Chevrolet placed first, second and third in 2011, with Muller finishing ahead of teammates Rob Huff and Alain Menu. Chevrolet finished 1-2-3 again in 2012, this time, Huff becoming champion ahead of Menu and Muller. The Cruze also entered the British Touring Car Championship for 2010 and 2011. Jason Plato won the championship for Chevrolet in 2010 and finished 3rd in 2011. The BTCC Cruze used the 2.0-liter naturally aspirated engine found in the original variant of the WTCC Cruze. The Cruze won the Scandinavian Touring Car Championship in 2011, being run by NIKA Racing under the banner of 'Chevrolet Motorsport Sweden' with Rickard Rydell driving. Rydell and teammate Michel Nykjaer finished second and third in 2012. Chevrolet pulled their sponsorship at the end of 2011 from the BTCC to support the Chevrolet team in the World Touring Car Championship for 2012. Chevrolet then announced they would not enter a works team for the 2013 WTCC season. For 2013 RML, the original builders of the Cruzes, continued to compete without the support of Chevrolet. Cars were also entered by Bamboo Engineering, NIKA Racing and Tuenti Racing Team. Despite no funding from the manufacturer, the Cruze remained the car to beat, even against works teams from Honda and Lada. Muller won his fourth WTCC title, his third in a Cruze and James Nash won the Yokohama Drivers' Trophy for independent entries, ahead of fellow Cruze drivers Alex MacDowall and Michel Nykjaer. RML have confirmed they will build Cruzes to the new set of WTCC regulations for 2014, which sees the cars increase in power and feature greater aerodynamics. RML aim to build up to six cars. Confirmed recipients include Tom Chilton who has yet to announce a team to run his car, Bamboo Engineering who will run two cars and Campos Racing who will enter a car for Hugo Valente. The Cruze returned to the BTCC in 2013 in the hands of Joe Girling and Tech-Speed Motorsport, who loaned the car from Finesse Motorsport. The increase in performance of the Next Generation Touring Car entries meant the older Super 2000 specification cars like the Cruze were now too uncompetitive to compete for wins but were provided with their own category. Now running a 2.0-litre turbocharged NGTC- specification engine, Girling took one class win at Donington Park but missed the second half of the season. The car returned to Finesse Motorsport who entered the Knockhill round of the championship with Aiden Moffat driving. At sixteen years old, Moffat became the BTCC's youngest driver at 16 years, 10 months and 28 days. This was to be the S2000 Cruze's final appearance in the BTCC, as S2000 cars are to be abolished from 2014. Andy Neate entered the 2013 season with a new NGTC-specification Cruze, built by his own team, IP Tech Race Engineering and used an engine built by RML. The car made its debut at Snetterton and competed at several rounds towards the end of the season. The car has since been sold to Aiden Moffat, who will run the car with his own team for 2014. BTC Racing will enter a hatchback variant of the Cruze for 2014, driven by Chris Stockton. The car was originally intended to be used by Jason Plato in 2012 but RML and Chevrolet withdrew from the BTCC and mothballed the shell. BTC Racing acquired it and were initially included on the entry list for 2013 but the car was not finished in time and never appeared all season. The first-generation Chevrolet Cruze debuted in the Argentine TC 2000 in 2011, and the second-generation in 2016. Agustin Canapino won the 2016 championship. == Sales == ;By country {| class = "wikitable" ! Year ! Australia ! Chinahttp://carsalesbase.com/china-car-sales- data/chevrolet/chevrolet-cruze/ !
