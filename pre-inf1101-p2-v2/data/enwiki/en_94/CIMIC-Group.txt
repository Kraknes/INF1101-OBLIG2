In October 2013 Fairfax Media alleged that Leighton Holdings had made corrupt payments to Hussain al-Shahristani, Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq, to secure an oil pipeline contract in Iraq and other contracts. Basil Al Jarah, the Iraq country manager for Unaoil, a Monaco-based company allegedly acting for Leighton Holdings, subsequently pleaded guilty to corruption. By March 2014, Spanish company ACS Group, through its acquisition of a majority shareholding in Hochtief, was the majority owner of Leighton Holdings. In June 2014, Verdes also became chairman of Leighton's executive board. In December 2014, Leighton Holdings sold John Holland to China Communications Construction for $1.15 billion. In April 2015, in the wake of the earlier corruption allegations against Leighton Holdings, ACS changed Leighton's name to CIMIC Group (abbreviated from Construction, Infrastructure, Mining and Concessions). In March 2016, CIMIC purchased mining company Sedgman for A$256 million. In December 2016, CIMIC purchased engineering company UGL Limited for A$524 million. ==Structure== CIMIC Group includes the following businesses: *CPB Contractors, including Leighton Asia and Broad (construction) *Thiess (mining) *Sedgman (mining) *UGL Limited (services) *Pacific Partnerships (public private partnerships) *EIC Activities (consultancy) *Ventia (services) ==Major projects== Antilia, the world's most valuable private residence, South Mumbai, India Major projects undertaken by Leighton Contractors (renamed CPB Contractors in January 2016) include: *Yarra Glen Road, Canberra, completed in 1967Woden Parkway construction, The Canberra Times, Page 10, 19 September 1966 *Ross River Dam, Queensland, completed in 1971 *Australian Astronomical Observatory, Sydney, completed in 1971 *Tallowa Dam, New South Wales, completed in 1976Tallowa Contract Sets Record Leighton News Letter issue 16 August 1972 *Canberra Stadium, completed in 1977 *Bowen Bridge, Tasmania, completed in 1984 *Burdekin Dam, Queensland, completed in 1987 *Brisbane Airport, completed in 1988 *Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre, completed in 1988 *Newman to Port Hedland section of the Great Northern Highway, completed in 1990 *ABC Centre, Ultimo, completed in 1991 *Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre, completed in 1995 *Star City Casino, Sydney, completed in 1997 *North Lantau Highway, Hong Kong, completed in 1997 *Olympic Park railway station, Sydney, completed in 1998 *Eastern Distributor tunnel, Sydney, completed in 1999 *Second Narrows Road Bridge, Perth, completed in 2001 *Westlink M7, Sydney, completed in 2005 *Cross City Tunnel, Sydney, completed in 2005 *Westpac Place, Sydney, completed in 2006Westpac Place Leighton Properties *Mandurah railway line, Western Australia, completed in 2007 *North-West T-way, Sydney, completed in 2007 *Eagle's Nest Tunnel and Sha Tin Heights Tunnel, Hong Kong, completed in 2008 *Buranda to Coorparoo sections of the Eastern Busway, Queensland, completed in 2009 *Forrest Highway, Western Australia, competed in 2009 *Clem Jones Tunnel, Brisbane, completed in 2010 *Antilia Building, India, completed in 2010 *Gateway Bridge Duplication, Brisbane, completed in 2011 *ABC Brisbane Centre, completed in 2012 *Deer Park West to West Werribee Junction, Regional Rail Link, Melbourne, completed in 2015Deer Park - West Werribee Junction Regional Rail Link, Retrieved 4 January 2020 *South Island line, Hong Kong, completed in 2016 *Redevelopment of the Royal Adelaide Hospital, completed in 2017 *Northern Beaches Hospital, Sydney, completed in 2018 *The northern section of the Hong Kong West Kowloon railway station, completed in 2018 *M4 East, Sydney, completed in 2019 *Canberra Metro, completed in 2019 *Sydney Metro Northwest, Sydney, completed in 2019 *West Gate Tunnel, Melbourne, due to be completed in 2022 *Sydney Metro City & Southwest, Sydney, due to be completed in 2021 *Sunbury railway line upgrade, Melbourne, due to be completed in 2023 *Parramatta Light Rail, Sydney, due to be completed in 2023 ==Ownership== About 70% of the shares in CIMIC Group are held by Hochtief which in turn is owned by the ACS Group.Financial report 2014 ==Hong Kong railway project== Leighton Asia, a subsidiary of CIMIC Group, was awarded the contract for constructing the Hung Hom station extension of the Sha Tin to Central Link, a high profile railway network extension project in Hong Kong in 2013.
