She was laid down on 27 August 1914 and was commissioned on 8 November 1915. ==Design== Like all post-E8 British E-class submarines, E22 had a displacement of at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of and a beam length of . She was powered by two Vickers eight-cylinder two- stroke diesel engines and two electric motors.Akerman, P. (1989). Encyclopaedia of British submarines 1901-1955\. p.150. Maritime Books. The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of . British E-class submarines had fuel capacities of of diesel and ranges of when travelling at . E21 was capable of operating submerged for five hours when travelling at . E22 was armed with five 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, two in the bow, one either side amidships, and one in the stern; a total of 10 torpedoes were carried. E-Class submarines had wireless systems with power ratings; in some submarines, these were later upgraded to systems by removing a midship torpedo tube. Their maximum design depth was although in service some reached depths of below . Some submarines contained Fessenden oscillator systems. ==Crew== Her complement was three officers and 28 men. ==Service history== E22 was involved in experiments in the North Sea to intercept Zeppelins on 24 April 1916.
