7221 series was a diesel motor railbus on Croatian Railways (). This series was used on branch lines with low traffic. This series was very economic. Unfortunately, it was (by today's standards) very uncomfortable. The motor was very loud when running at higher speeds. This series was conceived to be modular. It was possible to couple motor units and unpowered cars together, and drive them centrally as one train unit. This was rarely used, when there was demand on lines. It is very similar to and derives from the German "Schienenbus". == Curiosity == Disabled unit for spare parts on Vinkovci "Ranzirni Kolodvor" in winter Disabled unit for spare parts on Vinkovci "Ranzirni Kolodvor" on a warm day There also exists a special version of this vehicle. It is painted blue and is used as a track measure train. It is located in Zagreb, on "Ranzirni Kolodvor" and used occasionally to monitor track on branch lines. ==External links== *Details 7221 Category:Train-related introductions in 1955 Category:1955 in rail transport
