The 2002 Washington State Cougars football team represented Washington State University in the 2002 NCAA Division I-A football season. The team was led by fourteenth-year head coach Mike Price, and played its home games on campus at Martin Stadium in Pullman, Washington. Washington State was 10-2 in the regular season and 7-1 in the Pac-10, co-champions with USC. They defeated the Trojans in overtime in early October, but lost to unranked Washington in triple overtime in the Apple Cup at Pullman; WSU regrouped and beat UCLA by three touchdowns two weeks later. The seventh-ranked Cougars were invited to the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day, but were soundly defeated by the Oklahoma Sooners, and dropped to tenth in the final rankings. The Rose Bowl was the final game for Price at WSU; he left for Alabama, but never coached a game for the Crimson Tide. Longtime defensive coordinator Bill Doba was promoted to head coach for 2003, and he led the Cougar program for five years. ==Schedule== ==Roster== : ===Coaching staff=== * Head coach: Mike Price * Assistants: Robb Akey, Chris Ball, Bob Connelly, Bill Doba, Kasey Dunn, Mike Levenseller, Robin Pflugrad, Aaron Price, Mike Walker :2012 Washington State Cougars football information guide. ==Game summaries== ===USC=== Washington State's first win over USC in Pullman in sixteen years.USA Today.
