"Love Is All We Need" is a song by American singer Mary J. Blige, featuring additional vocals from rapper Nas. It was written by Blige, James Harris III, Terry Lewis, and Nasir Jones for Blige's third studio album, Share My World (1997), while production was helmed by Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. The song contains a sample of the song "Moonchild" (1985) by American singer Rick James. With its more buoyant tone, "Love Is All We Need" stood in conspicuous contrast to much of the more dark-rooted material featured on Blige's earlier albums. ==Release and reaction== While well received in America as an airplay single, the song was never given a physical release in the US and as a result the song never charted on the Hot 100 singles chart, though it did reach number one on the US dance singles chart. Meanwhile, the song became an international hit reaching number fifteen on the UK singles charts; Blige's first top twenty UK hit since 1995's "Mary Jane (All Night Long)." A remix of the song features a separate rap cameo by Foxy Brown and a vocal interpolation of Diana Ross' "Do You Know Where You're Going To (Theme from Mahogany)". ==Music video== The music video was shot in New York City from February 24-25, 1997, where Mary is at an office singing her verse and the second scene was a fashion show, Nas is in a fancy chair rapping his verse and the third scene is where Mary is on top of a roof building at the end of the song. ==Track listings== ;CD 1 # "Love Is All We Need" (Album Version) # "Love Is All We Need" (Instant Flava Remix) # "Love Is All We Need" (Mark's Needy Vocal) # "Love Is All We Need" (DYMK Club Mix) ;CD 2 # "Love Is All We Need" (Cutfather & Joe Remix) # "Love Is All We Need" (Cutfather & Joe Stripped Down Mix) # "Love Is All We Need" (Elusive Club Mix) # "Love Is All We Need" (Mark!s Faster Mary Faster Dub) # "Love Is All We Need" (Hard On Dub) ;Cassette # "Love Is All We Need" (Album Version) # "Love Is All We Need" (Cutfather & Joe Remix) ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from the Share My World liner notes. * Mary J.
