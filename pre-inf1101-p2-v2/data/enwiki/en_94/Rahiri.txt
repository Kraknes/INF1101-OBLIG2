Rahiri is the tupuna (ancestor) of Ngapuhi of Northland and Ngati Rahiri Tumutumu of the Hauraki District in New Zealand.The descendants of Rahiri Ngapuhi is today the largest Maori iwi (tribe) in New Zealand. Rahiri's significance for Ngapuhi is that all the chiefly lines of descent in Ngapuhi trace descent through him. As the saying goes: :Mehemea he uri koe no Ngapuhi, kihai e koe i heke ia Rahiri, he hoiho ke koe! (If you are Ngapuhi and do not descend from Rahiri, then you are a horse!) Rahiri lived some time in the period 1475-1585, based on whakapapa (genealogical) calculations. He traced descent from Kupe of the Matawhaorua canoe and Nukutawhiti of the enlarged and renamed Ngatokimatawhaorua canoe. He was the son of Tauramoko and Te Hauangiangi, and was born at Whiria pa, near Opononi in the Hokianga. His first wife was Ahuaiti from Pouerua. From this union came the first-born son, Uenuku. Uenuku was also known as Uenuku-kuare (Uenuku who was not blessed upon birth due to the ignorance of those accompanying his mother): while still a young boy, together with his mother Ahuaiti, he was cast out by Rahiri and it was only when he was a young man that he was reconciled with his father Rahiri. Ahuaiti had allegedly given her visiting brothers some of Rahiri's best fern root, contrary to his instructions to her. This was the reason for her exile. Rahiri's second wife was Whakaruru and from this union came Kaharau who, together with Uenuku founded the military might of Ngapuhi. Upon reconciliation, the then territories of Ngapuhi were divided up by Rahiri on the basis of the flight and landing place of the kite, Tuhoronuku. Uenuku and Kaharau further consolidated connection through marriage of children. Rahiri had other wives, two being Moetonga and Paru, descendants of these wives respectively settling the west and east coasts within Ngapuhi-controlled territories, creating hapu in those places. ==References== Category:Maori mythology
