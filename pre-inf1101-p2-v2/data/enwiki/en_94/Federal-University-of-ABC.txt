Federal University of ABC (, UFABC) is a Brazilian institution of higher learning based in Santo Andre, with operations in several municipalities in the ABC region, all in the state of Sao Paulo. The chairman of the committee that formulated the proposal of the university was Luiz Bevilacqua, who became its second rector. UFABC is the only federal university in Brazil with 100% of its professors holding Ph.D.s and, for the second consecutive year in 2011, emerged as the only university in Brazil with impact factor in scientific publications above the world average according to SCImago Institutions Rankings. ==History and expansion== UFABC's campus in Santo Andre. In 2004, the Ministry of Education sent to Congress the Bill 3962/2004, which created the Federal University of ABC. This law was enacted by the president and published in the Official Gazette of 27 July 2005, under No. 11,145 and dated 26 July 2005. UFABC aims at the integration of several campi in the ABC Region. Campi are located in the cities of Santo Andre (headquarters) and Sao Bernardo do Campo. ===Deans=== UFABC first dean was the former dean from UNICAMP, professor Hermano Tavares, whose term lasted from 2005 until 2007. Tavares was succeeded by the former president of the Brazilian Space Agency, professor Luiz Bevilacqua, who was his vice-rector and chair of the committee of implementation of the university. For health reasons, Bevilacqua resigned in mid-2008, and was succeeded by the former president of the Brazilian Society of Physics, professor Adalberto Fazzio. In January 2010, President Lula appointed the former dean of research of the UNICAMP and professor of USP, Helio Waldman to hold the post of rector of UFABC for the next four years. ===Recognition=== * The French newspaper Le Monde published an article that highlights the fact that it is the first Brazilian university to rely on 100% of professors with doctorates. * Writing in the Mexican Gnoseogenesis, the doctor Jose Luis Moran Lopez of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico highlights the pleasant surprise of the creation of UFABC and its interdisciplinary project created by 25 Brazilian scientists. * The portal of the Methodist University of Sao Paulo published an article on the inauguration of one of the blocks UFABC made by the then-president of the Republic, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva where it talks about the goal of leaving the UFABC among the 100 best universities in the world, for example, ahead of the Brazilian university USP that was in 138th position among the best universities in the world. * Writing in the Portal Luis Nassif, Adalberto Fazzio (professor, USP) and Armando Z. Milioni (associate professor, ITA), highlight the six interdisciplinary axes at AFABC and the fact that less than 50% of the subjects that make up student grades are compulsory. * During the presentation of the seminar "Interdisciplinarity", held in April 2009, a professor of Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), doctor Alaor Clark commented that he considers the UFABC the most advanced interdisciplinary project in Brazil and in the world. * In a presentation to the Center of Physics of Porto (Portugal), the professor doctor Daniel Zanetti de Florio cites the fact that UFABC have an innovative educational project based on Bologna Process. * In an article in the newspaper Diario do Grande ABC by the then-dean of research in UFABC, Helio Waldman comments that the newly created UFABC was born in an advanced stage for the 20th century and achieved in a few years the development in research that universities such as USP and Unicamp, for example, took decades to build. The article is constructed from the result of a notice that shows the UFABC in the first time of Brazilian universities in nanotechnology. * Another article published in the Diario do Grande ABC by professor Armando Zeferino Milioni (ITA) said the creation of the Masters and Doctorate of UFABC and highlights its qualified staff. ==Undergraduate teaching== 243x243px Unlike many universities in Brazil, where the curriculum has a fixed order, at UFABC, the student can decide the order in which the subjects will be taken, without prerequisites, only recommendations. That means that anyone can take any subject, given that the class isn't full. Also the year is divided in three four-months periods, instead of two semesters. At the end of each period, the student chooses the classes they want to take. On each class, the students are listed by their CR (which is UFABC's version of the GPA) and the first ones will attend that class on the next period. However, if the class is from a specific course, the criteria becomes the CP (a number ranging from 0 to 1 that indicates how much of that specific course was completed by that student). All disciplines have an associated "credit", which represents the number of classes per two weeks. After their basic university education, the student has several options: they can enter the job market with a bachelor's degree in Science and Technology or may continue at the university and attend one or two years in a bachelor's program specifically or eight forms of engineering. There is also the possibility of holding a master's degree and moving to master's degree programs in other national and international programs. The graduate of an interdisciplinary bachelor's program of a university may enroll in up to two of 21 options for undergraduate courses as their basic training, divided into bachelor's degrees and. The UFABC was the first institution of higher education in Brazil to adopt the interdisciplinary bachelor's degree. === Disciplines === There are three types of disciplines at UFABC, mandatory, limited option and free. The type of any given discipline is different for each course, meaning that the same discipline might be of one type on a course, but of other type on another. Mandatory disciplines are the ones required by a course in order to finish it. For computer science students, Databases discipline required, so for the computer science course, it is mandatory. Limited option disciplines are meant to enhance the student's knowledge on a certain field of study. Molecular evolution, for example, is a limited option discipline for Biology students. Free disciplines are all disciplines that don't fit in either one of the previous categories. LIBRAS is a free discipline on all non-licentiate courses. === Evaluation === The fact that the curriculum has no fixed order introduces some disadvantages, for example, one professor may apply harder exams than the others, creating a disparity between grades on the same discipline. Some, however, are "unified", meaning that the same exams and evaluations will be applied to all students, preventing that disparity. Excluding Quantum Physics and Structure of Matter, all Physics related disciplines are unified. Different disciplines have different evaluation systems. One may have three, two, one or no exams at all (in this case, the evaluation is made via a project developed by the student). There may also be a student project and one or two exams. Students who get a lower than C grade have the option to do one last exam, which is sometimes referred to as "recovery exam", that can increase their grade up to a C. If one gets an F and doesn't do well on the recovery exam, they will have to redo the discipline. === Coefficients === At UFABC, all undergrad students have four coefficients. They are the CR, the CA, the CP_k and the I_k . ==== CR ("Coeficiente de Rendimento", orYield Coefficient) ==== It represents how well the student is doing at the disciplines. As mentioned, it is the equivalent of the GPA. It can be calculated by the following formula:CR = \textstyle \frac{\textstyle \sum_{k=1}^{NC}C_i \cdot f(N_i) \displaystyle}{\textstyle \sum_{k=1}^{NC}C_i \displaystyle}\displaystyle Where NC is the number of completed disciplines, N_i is the grade on that discipline, C_i is the discipline's credits and f(N_i) is: f(A) = 4, f(B) = 3, f(C) = 2, f(D) = 1 and f(F) = 0. ==== CA ("Coeficiente Academico", or Academic Coefficient) ==== It is similar to the CR, however, if a student takes the same discipline multiple times, only the one with the higher grade will be accounted. It is calculated using the following formula:CA = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{ND} CR_i \cdot f(MC_i)}{\sum_{k=1}^{ND} CR_i} Where ND is the number of different disciplines taken by the student, CR_i is the number of credits on that discipline MC_iis the greatest grade on that discipline. f(MC_i) is: f(A) = 4, f(B) = 3, f(C) = 2, f(D) = 1 and f(F) = 0. ==== CPk ("Coeficiente de Progressao", or Progression Coefficient) ==== Represents the ratio between the approved disciplines' credits on a course k and the total of credits on that course. It grows as the student finishes disciplines according to their category (mandatory, limited option and free). When it reaches 1, it means that student has finished all the required credits on that course k. Its formula is: CP_k = \frac{n^k_{man} + min[(N^k_{lim} + N^k_{free}), n^k_{lim} + min(n^k_{free},N^k_{free})]}{NC_k} Where: * n^k_{man} is the number of approved credits on the mandatory disciplines; * n^k_{lim} is the number of approved credits on the limited option disciplines; * n^k_{free} is the number of approved credits on the free disciplines; * N^k_{man} is the total number of required credits on mandatory disciplines for the course k; * N^k_{lim} is the total number of required credits on limited option disciplines for the course k; * N^k_{free} is the suggested number of credits on free disciplines for the course k. ==== Ik ("Coeficiente de Afinidade", or Affinity Coefficient) ==== It combines the CP_k , the CR and the number of periods a student has studied on the university. The calculation is as follows: I_k = (0,07 \cdot CR) + (0,63 \cdot CPk) + (0,005 \cdot T) ===Bachelor of Science and Technology (BC&T;)=== Bachelor of Science and Technology is a general course that teaches the foundation on mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry and computer science, while giving a slight introduction on human sciences. The idea behind that is to have students working with interdisciplinary subjects via a methodology that encourages an investigative approach to situations and stimulates scientific research and production. Examples of subjects studied are: * Classical mechanics * Thermodinamics * Electromagnetism * Quantum mechanics * Epistemology * Interactions between science and society * Calculus * Basic programming * Origins and evolution of life * Basic chemistry The course takes a total of 2,400 hours of study to be completed.Lockers for students in a corridor of UFABC ===Bachelor of Science and Humanities (BC&H;)=== The Bachelor of Science and Humanities is a course of general science. The initiation in Natural Science, Formal, Social, and Philosophy is through lectures with participation in research groups, under the supervision of a senior researcher. The course also takes 2,400 hours to finish. ===Post-BC&T; and post-BC&H; degrees=== After completing either the BC&T; or the BC&H;, the student can choose up to two specific degrees to pursue. Students that graduate on BC&T; have the following options: * Santo Andre's campus: **Biology (Graduation or Licentiate) **Chemistry (Graduation or Licentiate) **Computer Science **Mathematics (Graduation or Licentiate) **Physics (Graduation or Licentiate) **Environmental engineering **Energy engineering **Information engineering **Mechatronics **Materials science * Sao Bernardo's campus: **Neuroscience **Aerospace engineering **Biomedical engineering **Engineering management Students that graduate on BC&H;, can choose between (all of them at Sao Bernardo's campus): * Economics * Philosophy (Graduation or Licentiate) * Spatial planning * Public policies * International relations alt=One of the laboratories in One of the laboratories in materials science from UFABC. ==Research== The UFABC is the only federal university in the Brazil that has 100% of professors with a doctoral degree. UFABC research in Nanotechnology has been recognised by CNPq. Researchers in Nanotechnology in UFABC were able to publish articles in the scientific journal Nano Letters. The university employs professors who received the Capes awards for Best Thesis, researchers with the Commendation and the Grand Cross of the Brazilian Order of Scientific Merit, members of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences, and representatives of national scientific organizations. Professor's room in Block A In March 2007 the CAPES approved 10 of 11 applications for the opening of post-graduate studies (Master and Doctorate). The CAPES on average approves only one third of the applications referred to it. UFABC participates in major research projects worldwide, among them the presence of the university in the largest scientific project of all time, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) that is operating the largest particle accelerator ever built and also in the DZero Experiment of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) of the United States Department of Energy that conducts research on the basic structure of matter in the second-largest particle accelerator in the world. The university has a presence in the first Brazilian space mission to deep space, the Mission Aster (Missao Aster), of the Brazilian Space Agency, which provides for the launching of a space probe in 2015.

In this course, classes are held Monday through Friday by students from the undergraduate institution; these are complemented with cultural activities and lectures by professors from UFABC on Saturdays. Some of the students who teach classes are scholarship of the Pro- rectory of University Extension while the majority are student volunteers. ==Selection of students== The first three classes of UFABC were formed through the selection processes via Vestibular. The students enrolled in the years 2007 to 2009. From 2010 the selection of new students is done with the ENEM. classes. The Bachelor of Science and Technology of UFABC was the most sought- after course in the country in the "Unified Selecting System" (SISU) of Ministry of Education in 2010. According to statistics collected by the institution, the Bachelor of Science and Technology (BC&T;) had a demand of 13,758 applicants competing for 1,500 places (candidate/vacancy ratio of 9.2, with a 10,9% acceptance rate), while the Bachelor of Science and Humanities (BC&H;) has 2320 registered for 200 places (candidate/vacancy ratio of 11.6, with an 8,6% acceptance rate). There is a reservation of 50% of seats of all its courses in both periods (morning and evening) for candidates who attended high school in public schools, as well as those self-declared indigenous and African descent.Main entrance of Block B == Infrastructure == Corridor of Block B The Federal University of ABC has modern facilities in the city of Santo Andre (SP) and facilities under construction in Sao Bernardo do Campo (SP).Santo Andre's campus === Centers and cores === The university has abolished the system of "departments" and "schools" that exist in other universities. In UFABC, all professors are bound to one of three major Centres Interdisciplinary: * CMCC - Center of Mathematics, Computing and Cognition * CECS - Center of Engineering, Modelling and Applied Social Sciences * CCNH - Centre for Natural Sciences and Humanities Besides these, professors may be associated with the Interdisciplinary Centers linked to the rectory of UFABC: * NCSC - Center for Cognition and Complex Systems * NCTS - Center for Science, Technology and Society There are organs like the President's Office, Office of International Affairs, Center for Information Technology and Center for Technological Innovation, in addition to several secretaries and numerous research groups. ===Campus of Santo Andre=== Santo Andre's Campus of the UFABC has six blocks, a total of 96409.03 square meters of built area in the headquarters campus of the university. The design of the campus of Santo Andre was by Libeskindllovet Architects S/S Ltda. and the construction work was in charge of the Constructor Augusto Velloso SA. Besides these main blocks located between the Avenida dos Estados and Avenida Santa Adelia, in Santo Andre city, the UFABC has a building with teaching laboratory, computer rooms and classrooms on Avenida Altantica, in Valparaiso neighborhood, and an administrative headquarters at Rua Catequese, in Jardim neighborhood, both in Santo Andre. The university has acquired a large piece of land to the other side of the Avenida dos Estados (across from the current headquarters) to build new research laboratories and support to engineering. ===Campus of Sao Bernardo do Campo=== On 25 August 2009 President Lula, accompanied by first lady Marisa Leticia, the Minister of Education, Fernando Haddad, the mayor of Sao Bernardo do Campo, Luiz Marinho, the deputy mayor, Frank Aguiar, and the Senator of the state of Sao Paulo, Aloisio Mercadante, laid the foundation stone of the campus of UFABC the city of Sao Bernardo do Campo. The campus of Sao Bernardo do Campo UFABC has six blocks. The project is designed by Benno Perelmutter Architecture and Planning S/C Ltda. Besides these six blocks, UFABC has a building with teaching laboratory, computer rooms and classrooms located in downtown Sao Bernardo do Campo, in the former headquarters of the College Salete named Block Sigma. ==University-enterprise integration== The Board of Education and Research (Consep) of UFABC published in 2010 a resolution asking for corporations and industries interested in signing agreements of internship to enable the students to form placements in these firms. More than 100 companies signed the agreement with UFABC in 2010. Among such companies are names like IBM, Itau, Nestle, Globo Organizations, General Motors (GM), Ford, Siemens, Honda, Sun Microsystems, Pirelli, BASF, and Accenture. ==Sport== Students can play basketball, chess, handball, futsal, volleyball, swimming, table tennis, soccer, rugby and martial arts. Students take part in competitions with universities throughout Brazil. In the Tournament "Semana da Asa" that occurs in the CTA, annually organized by the ITA, the athletes of UFABC won 3rd place overall in the first year of participation in 2008, and 1st place overall in the second year of participation in 2009; In 2010, the Engenhariadas tournament brought together engineering colleges), the University Games Paulistanos (organized by the city of Sao Paulo), the Liga Deportiva Universitaria Paulista (major league sports university in the country) and the Cup of the University of Sao Carlos, the TUSCA, (organized by UFSCar and USP-Sao Carlos). ===Academic Athletic Association September XI=== On 11 September 2006, the first class entered the Federal University of ABC. In 2007 a group of students began the Athletic UFABC, starting the Academic Athletic Association XI September (Portuguese: Associacao Atletica Academica XI de Setembro), AXIS, whose name was chosen in homage to the days of the first class. {| width="30%" border=1 align=right bgcolor="#f0f0f0" |+ style="font-weight:bold;"|Academic Athletic Association September XI | {| | style="font-weight:bold;"| Established: | 2007 |- | style="font-weight:bold;"| Mascot: | Anteater |- | style="font-weight:bold;"| Colors: | Green and yellow |- | style="font-weight:bold;"| Address: | Santa Adelia Street, 166, Bangu Neighborhood - Santo Andre (SP) |- | style="font- weight:bold;"| Percussion Band: | Infanteria |} |} AXIS is now a student representation recognized by UFABC formed by an elected board and that represents all athletes of the university. The Athletics (AXIS) of UFABC supports sports at the university, and conducts the selection of athletes for the leagues in which they participate. The campuses of UFABC have sports fields, swimming pools, gyms and sports courts. Furthermore, AXIS has agreements with SESI (Social Service of Industry) of Santo Andre and with Santo Andre's Club Bochofilo for the use of sport facilities of these sites by the students of the institution. AXIS works closely with the DCE (Central Directory of Students) of UFABC organizing parties, sponsoring the travel of athletes, performing the manufacture and sale of customized sports equipment (such as shirts, kimonos, swimming caps, etc.), and providing training and transportation for the athletes to participate in tournaments and doing extra activities such as mountaineering, abseiling and internal tournaments. Groups linked to Athletic's UFABC are Cheerleaders, the Infantry (responsible for the UFABC's fanfare in sports tournaments) and the Martial Arts Group, who train practitioners of Karate, Kung Fu, Tae Kwon Do and other martial arts. ==Student representation== The DCE (Central Directory of Students) represents the graduate students. Its members are chosen in an annual election in which all undergraduates can vote. The Directory of UFABC was established in 2008, from the former Academic Center, and helps students' stay, by helping with their problems, monitoring projects that relate to academic life, as discussions in ConsEP, ConsUni and CEU. The UFABC has student organizations representing groups of students. Some of these are officially recognized by the university while others rely on the coordination of support from professors and education cores, including: * Athletics: the Athletic Association Academic Eleventh of September, or AXIS, deals with student representation on matters involving student athletes from UFABC, always working with the DCE. * Branch of the IEEE: The student branch of IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the professional organization that brings together professionals from all engineering and computing) of UFABC promotes the dissemination of scientific and technical knowledge of the exact sciences in UFABC.
