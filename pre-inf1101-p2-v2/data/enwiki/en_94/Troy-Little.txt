He ventured into webcomics with the online serial Angora Napkin: The Golden McGuffin that ran sporadically from 2011-2019. From 2013-2014 he wrote and drew the comic book series The Powerpuff Girls, published by IDW and based on the Cartoon Network animated series. 2015 brought the news that Little had created the authorized graphic novel adaptation of Hunter S.
