Kininogen-1 (KNG1), also known as alpha-2-thiol proteinase inhibitor, Williams-Fitzgerald-Flaujeac factor or the HMWK-kallikrein factor is a proteinUniProt: that in humans is encoded by the KNG1 gene. Kininogen-1 is the precursor protein to high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK), low- molecular-weight kininogen (LMWK), and bradykinin. == Expression == The KNG1 gene uses alternative splicing to generate two different proteins: high- molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) and low-molecular-weight kininogen (LMWK). HMWK in turn is cleaved by the enzyme kallikrein to produce bradykinin. * KNG1 gene - low-molecular-weight kininogen (LMWK) protein (contains 427 amino acids) or high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) protein (644 amino acids) * HMWK protein - bradykinin peptide (9 amino acids) == Function == HMWK is essential for blood coagulation and assembly of the kallikrein-kinin system. Also, bradykinin, a peptide causing numerous physiological effects, is released from HMWK. In contrast to HMWK, LMWK is not involved in blood coagulation. Kininogen-1 is a constituent of the blood coagulation system as well as the kinin-kallikrein system. == See also == * high-molecular-weight kininogen * low-molecular-weight kininogen * bradykinin == References == == Further reading == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * == External links == * LMWK laboratory information Category:Coagulation system Category:Kinin-kallikrein system Category:Cofactors
