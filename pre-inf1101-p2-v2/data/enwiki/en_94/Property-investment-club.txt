A property investment club is an organisation which focuses on marketing property investments such as buy to let investments and below market value (BMV) properties to property investors. Property investment clubs and companies can offer members (and non-members) discounted investment opportunities on new build, off-plan, distress sale and other properties. These 'clubs' and 'companies' may charge a membership fee and/or sourcing fee and/or finder's fees as well as reservation fees for these properties. There are many different property investment clubs offering different investments for varying costs. Some offer educational information in the form of courses, e-books and others. A minority of large 'clubs' have received a dishonorable reputation in the recent past and if you are considering investing with the assistance of a property investment club it is worth finding out what members can expect to receive for what fees. ==References== * bunyang, modelhauseu * bunyangmodelhauseu * hilseuteiteu sindorimyeog senteureol * ganghwa hilseuteiteu * unjeongsindosi jeilpunggyeongcae geurangpeoseuteu Category:Real estate investing
