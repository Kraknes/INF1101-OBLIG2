{| |} The Convair P6Y was an unbuilt aircraft designed by Convair in the 1950s. The design was initiated to meet a requirement of the United States Navy (USN) for an anti-submarine warfare seaplane. == History == The design was for a flying boat that would make use of boundary layer control to achieve slow speed flight. It was intended that this would enable the aircraft to land on the open ocean in rough seas and deploy a dipping sonar.P6Y web page at globalsecurity.org retrieved 2007-11-15. Other visual features of the design were an extremely large swept vertical fin that, combined with the dorsal fin and rudder, would have been about half the total length of the aircraft, and a thimble nose radome.Convair P6Y design drawing retrieved 2007-11-15. Two prototypes were ordered under the USN designation XP6Y-1 with the BuNos. (Navy serial numbers) 147206 and 147207.aero-web.org retrieved 2007-11-15. The design had competition from the Martin P7M SubMaster,P7M web page at globalsecurity.org retrieved 2007-11-15. but the USN's preference was for the P6Y. Both types suffered from budget constraints and neither was built (although a mock-up of the P7M was constructed); the USN cancelled the contract for the two prototype XP6Y-1sUS Navy aircraft Bureau Number list, third series retrieved 2007-11-15. and later opted for the land-based P-3 Orion instead. ==Specifications (projected)== ==See also== ==References== P6Y Category:Trimotors Category:Aircraft with auxiliary jet engines Category:Cancelled military aircraft projects of the United States Category:Flying boats Category:Parasol-wing aircraft
