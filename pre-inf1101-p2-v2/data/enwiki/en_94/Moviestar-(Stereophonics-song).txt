"Moviestar" is a single by Stereophonics. It was the fourth and final single released from You Gotta Go There to Come Back and the first Stereophonics single released following the sacking of drummer Stuart Cable. The single peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart, number 26 on the Irish Singles Chart, and number 85 on the Dutch Top 100. ==Background== A demo version of the song was released online in 2003 via the band's official website in a section called "The Place", where people would send a mobile phone text message (costing PS1) to receive an access code to download the song in mp3 format. Due to high popularity and demand, the song was then fully mastered and finalized and released as a single in February 2004. "Moviestar" was then included on a re-issue of the band's 2003 album You Gotta Go There to Come Back. ==Track listings== CD1 #"Moviestar" (full-length version) #"Local Boy in the Photograph" (live) CD2 #"Moviestar" (live) #"The Bartender and the Thief" (live) #"Help Me (She's Out of Her Mind)" (live) #"Behind The Scenes on Tour" (video) DVD #"Moviestar" (video) #"Moviestar" (live) # Behind The Scenes Footage From the Recording of "Moviestar" #(Audio Section) "Moviestar" (full- length version) #(Audio Section) "Climbing the Wall" (live) 7" #"Moviestar" ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class="wikitable sortable plainrowheaders" style="text-align:center" !scope="col"|Chart (2004) !scope="col"|Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class="wikitable plainrowheaders" style="text-align:center" !scope="col"|Chart (2004) !scope="col"|Position |- !scope="row"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |194 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2004 singles Category:Stereophonics songs Category:Songs written by Kelly Jones Category:V2 Records singles Category:2004 songs Category:UK Independent Singles Chart number-one singles
