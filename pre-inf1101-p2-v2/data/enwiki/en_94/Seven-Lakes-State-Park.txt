The state park's of water are found in six named lakes that include 170-acre Big Seven Lake, Little Seven Lake, and 44-acre Dickinson Lake. ==History== The park's roots lie in a failed development scheme. In 1967, private interests built a dam on Swartz Creek in the Flint River watershed to create one large lake, Decoup Lake, from seven small lakes. When the developers gave up their efforts, the state purchased the site in 1969, naming it Seven Lakes State Park and its largest body of water Big Seven Lake. The park opened in 1977; a campground on Sand Lake was opened in 1992. ==Activities and amenities== Big Seven Lake offers fishing for largemouth and smallmouth bass, northern pike, walleye, yellow perch, black crappie, and channel catfish. Recreational facilities in the park include campsites, swimming beaches, picnic areas, boat launches, trails for hiking and mountain biking, and hunting areas. ==References== ==External links== *Seven Lakes State Park Michigan Department of Natural Resources *Seven Lakes State Park Map Michigan Department of Natural Resources Category:State parks of Michigan Category:Protected areas of Oakland County, Michigan Category:Protected areas established in 1971 Category:1971 establishments in Michigan Category:IUCN Category III
