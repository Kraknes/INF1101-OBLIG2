It was established in 1823Stratton, F.J.M. "The History of the Cambridge Observatories" Annals of the Solar Physics Observatory, Cambridge Vol. I (1949) and is now part of the site of the Institute of Astronomy. The old Observatory building houses the Institute of Astronomy Library which has a collection of modern and historical astronomical books.Hurn, M. "An English astronomical library: the case of the Cambridge Observatory" The Observatory, Vol. 124, No. 1178, pp. 37-46 (2004) There are a set of optical telescopes at the site on the Madingley Road in the west of Cambridge. By modern standards these are small, as well as being affected by light pollution. Nevertheless, the 36-inch telescope continues to be used for studies of stellar radial velocities and the historic Northumberland and Thorrowgood telescopes are used as part of the public outreach activities of the Institute. Much more significant is the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory, built in 1957, a few kilometres southwest. From 1990 to 1998, the Royal Greenwich Observatory was based in Cambridge in Greenwich House, just to the north of the Observatory. ==Notable Senior Observers== *John Couch Adamshttps://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/about/history/biographies.-.d *Hugh Ernest Butler *Arthur Eddingtonhttps://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/about/history/biographies.e.-.l *Hugh Newallhttps://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/about/history/biographies.m.-.s *Robert Woodhousehttps://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/about/history/biographies.t.-.z == References == ==See also== *List of largest optical telescopes in the British Isles == External links == * Institute of Astronomy website * Institute of Astronomy Library website Category:Astronomical observatories in England Observatory Observatory
