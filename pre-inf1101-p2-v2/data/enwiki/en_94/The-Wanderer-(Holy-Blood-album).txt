The Wanderer is the debut studio album by Ukrainian folk metal band Holy Blood. It was self-released on May 13, 2002 and re-released in 2005 through Bombworks Records. Musically, the album features a hybrid mixture of black metal and folk metal with Celtic influences and occasional death metal undercurrents, such as on the song "Kill". The overall output is more aggressive than anything the band has released since. The last song on the album is an industrial music remix of the song "Kill." On the Bombworks edition, all the lyrics are printed in English, although they are sung in Russian.Noise.fi : Holy Blood - The Wanderer -arvostelu In 2006, the album was re-issued in Ukraine with different cover art. ==Track listing== All music by Holy Blood. ==Personnel== *Fedor Buzilevich - lead vocals, flute *Olexiy Furman - lead guitar *Myhaylo Rodionov - rhythm guitar *Eugeniy Tsesaryov - bass *Dmitry Titorenko - drums *Vera Knyazyova - keyboards, vocals ==References== Category:Holy Blood (band) albums Category:2002 debut albums
