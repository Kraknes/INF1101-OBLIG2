Sir Paul Pindar and Ralph Pindar Sir Paul Pindar (1565-1650) was a merchant and, from 1611 to 1620, was Ambassador of King James I of England to the Ottoman Empire. Born in Wellingborough and educated at Wellingborough School Pindar entered trade as the apprentice to an Italian merchant in London. He later became involved when he received Company Articles to the Ottoman Empire on 27 September 1611. As secretary to the English ambassador in Constantinople he arrived in December 1611, eventually becoming ambassador himself. Pindar was present when the famous gift of an organ was made to the royal household by Ambassador Lello and he went on to become a favourite of Safiye Sultan, the powerful mother of Sultan Mehmed III. The frontage of Paul Pindar's house on Bishopgate is preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum. As ambassador he was "renowned for his generosity in educating young men at his own 'care and cost'" The Grand Signiors Serraglio - Robert Withers He was recalled on 25 January 1618 but did not leave until May 1620. Pindar was knighted by James I in 1623. A pamphlet published in London in 1642 states that Pindar saved the life of a felon named "Running Jack" who had been sentenced to death. The prisoner "was found to have bin such a notorious Malefactor, that the Bench did condemn him to dy: but hee hath since obtained a Reprieve by the means of Sir Paul Pindar." The pamphlet does not elaborate on his crimes, or on why Sir Paul had an interest in the case.The Parliaments Censure To The Jesuites And Fryers ..., April 1642. British Library, Wing Catalogue ref.
