The Alabama gubernatorial election of 1982 included the last campaign and final electoral victory of George Wallace. The election occurred on November 2, 1982. Incumbent Governor Fob James declined to run for a second term, allowing for an open election in 1982. In the Democratic primary, Wallace received challenges from Lieutenant Governor George McMillan, Speaker of the State House Joe McCorquodale, former Governor Jim Folsom, and Reuben McKinley. Because Wallace did not receive a majority of the votes, he advanced to a run- off with McMillan and then narrowly won the Democratic nomination. Montgomery Mayor Emory Folmar went unchallenged for the Republican nomination. Wallace, formerly a notorious segregationist, renounced those views in 1979. On November 2, 1982, Wallace not only won the general election, but also over 90% of the black vote. Overall, Wallace received 650,538 (57.64%) votes against Folmar's 440,815 (39.06%) votes. ==Background== Incumbent Governor Fob James declined to seek a second term. Shortly after former Governor George Wallace survived an assassination attempt in 1972, he renounced his infamous segregationist past, especially when he stood in front of the school house door at the University of Alabama in 1963, noting that, "I was wrong. Those days are over, and they ought to be over." With Governor James retiring, Wallace decided to run for a fourth non-consecutive term in 1982. ==Democratic primary== Incumbent Democratic Governor Fob James decided to not seek a second term. ===Candidates=== * Jim Folsom, former Governor * Joe McCorquodale, Speaker of the State House of Representatives * Reuben McKinley * George McMillan, Lieutenant Governor * George Wallace, former Governor ===Primary results=== * Wallace - 425,469 (42.53%) * McMillan - 296,271 (29.62%) * McCorquodale - 250,614 (25.05%) * Folsom - 17,333 (1.73%) * McKinley - 10,617 (1.06%) ====Runoff==== * Wallace - 512,203 (51.19%) * McMillan - 488,444 (48.81%) ==Republican primary== Emory M.
