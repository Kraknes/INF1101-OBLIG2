2010 Award winner: ONCE Foundation Award for Accessibility (Two joint winners) Category: Sport. Aviva Stadium, Ireland, Dublin by Populous in association with Scott Tallon Walker ::For complete list of winners see List of World Architecture Festival winners The World Architecture Festival (WAF) is an annual festival and awards ceremony, one of the most prestigious events dedicated to the architecture and development industry. The first four events were held in Barcelona, from 2008 to 2011, at which point the festival moved to Singapore for four years. Since 2016, host cities have included Berlin and Amsterdam. It is the only event where around 550 shortlisted architects present their projects live in crit rooms to a judging panel. One of these projects is awarded the World Building of the Year title. Each year the World Architecture Festival publishes a list of the winners of the awards on their official website. == History == The World Architecture Festival was first held in 2008 as a "festival and live awards competition dedicated to celebrating and sharing architectural excellence from across the globe." The first four festivals were held in Barcelona; since 2012 the annual events have been hosted by Singapore, Berlin, and Amsterdam. Over a thousand projects are entered in the competition for the awards and more than 550 of these are shortlisted for live presentation at the festival. The architects pay a submission fee to enter a Future Project or a Completed Building project and travel to where the festival is arranged to present the shortlisted project live to a jury panel. The entries are voluntary and the festival does not control who submits projects. In 2011, the sister event INSIDE Festival (for interior architecture and design) was added in the same venue and arranged at the same time as WAF. === The 2008 festival === 2008 Culture of the Year: Oslo Opera House, Norway, by Snohetta The World Architecture Festival was held for the first time on 22-24 October 2008 in Barcelona.
