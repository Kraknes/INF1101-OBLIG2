The Oberliga Sudwest () was the highest level of the German football league system in the southwest of Germany from 1945 until the formation of the Bundesliga in 1963. It covered the two states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland. ==Overview== The league was introduced as the highest level of football in the French occupation zone in 1945, replacing the Gauligas as such. As was the French occupation zone, the Oberliga was split into a northern and a southern zone. The northern zone continued till 1963 to form the Oberliga Sudwest while the southern zone was integrated into the Oberliga Sud in 1950. Until then, the champion of the Oberliga was determined by a home-and-away final between the two group winners. The clubs in the Oberliga Sud came from the following Gauligas: * Gauliga Westmark * Gauliga Moselland * Gauliga Baden (southern half only) In addition to the Oberliga Sudwest, four other Oberligas were formed in Germany in the 1940s. *Oberliga West (formed in 1947) *Oberliga Nord (formed in 1947) *Oberliga Berlin (formed in 1945, originally with clubs from west and east Berlin) *Oberliga Sud (formed in 1945) Next to the Oberliga Berlin, the Oberliga Sudwest was the smallest of the five Oberligas. Considering this, it is still impressive that it won two German titles through the 1. FC Kaiserslautern, led by the German captain Fritz Walter, still a legend in Kaiserslautern and Germany. Set below the Oberliga were originally the Amateurligas. In 1951 the 2. Oberliga Sudwest was formed to fit in between. With the reintroduction of the German championship in 1948, the winner and runners-up of the Oberliga Sudwest went on to the finals tournament with the other Oberliga champions. In 1950, the southern group of the Oberliga Sudwest was disbanded and its clubs joined the Southern German Football Association. From 1948 to 1951 the clubs from the Saarland did not take part in the Oberliga Sudwest, playing their own competition instead. The 1. FC Saarbrucken even took part in the French second division in 1948-49, winning the division but being refused further participation.France - List of Final Tables Second Level The 1. FC Kaiserslautern, Wormatia Worms and 1. FSV Mainz 05 took part in all of the 18 seasons of the Oberliga Sudwest. In 1978, the Oberliga Sudwest was reformed, as the third tier of German football, but still covering the same region. From the clubs that played the last season in 1963, the 1. FSV Mainz 05, FK Pirmasens, SV Sudwest Ludwigshafen, TuS Neuendorf and Eintracht Bad Kreuznach also saw the first season of the new league. ==Founding members of the Oberliga Sudwest (northern group)== *1. FC Saarbrucken *1. FC Kaiserslautern *Borussia Neunkirchen *Wormatia Worms *VfR Frankenthal *FK Pirmasens *Phonix Ludwigshafen *1. FC Idar *BFV Hassia Bingen *1. FSV Mainz 05 ==Disbanding of the Oberliga== With the introduction of the Bundesliga, two teams from the Oberliga Sudwest were admitted to the new Bundesliga. The remaining clubs went to the new Regionalliga Sudwest together with six clubs from the 2nd Oberliga Sudwest, one of five new second divisions. While the admittance of the 1. FC Kaiserslautern as the most prolific team of the Oberliga and champion of 1963 was logical, the pick of the 1. FC Saarbrucken was more than dubious, having only finished 5th in the Oberliga that year and coming in below the other Saarland side, Borussia Neunkirchen. ==Qualifying for the Bundesliga== The qualifying system for the new league was fairly complex. The league placings of the clubs playing in the Oberligen for the last ten seasons were taken into consideration, whereby results from 1952 to 1955 counted once, results from 1955 to 1959 counted double and results from 1959 to 1963 triple. A first-place finish was awarded 16 points, a sixteenth place one point. Appearances in the German championship or DFB-Pokal finals were also rewarded with points. The five Oberliga champions of the 1962-63 season were granted direct access to the Bundesliga. All up, 46 clubs applied for the 16 available Bundesliga slots. Following this system, by 11 January 1963, the DFB announced nine fixed clubs for the new league and reduced the clubs eligible for the remaining seven places to 20. Clubs within the same Oberliga that were separated by less than 50 points were considered on equal rank and the 1962-63 placing was used to determine the qualified team.DSFS Ligachronik: Qualifikation zur Bundesliga 1963 , page: B 11-12, publisher: Deutscher Sportclub fur Fussballstatistik - DSFS, accessed: 3 November 2008 Of the seven clubs from the league applying, the 1. FC Saarbrucken qualified early even though FK Pirmasens and Borussia Neunkirchen were less than ten points behind in the overall ranking and finished better in 1962-63. The rumor persists that Saarbrucken was chosen because it was from the home state of the later DFB chairman Hermann Neuberger (Chairman from 1975 to 1992), a very influential figure in German football. The DFB justified the choice of the 1. FCS with the fact that the club had a superior infrastructure to the other two. The 1. FC Kaiserslautern also qualified.
