"You're a Friend of Mine" is a 1985 hit song, written by Narada Michael Walden and Jeffrey Cohen, with lead vocals by Clarence Clemons and Jackson Browne in a duet. At the time of the song's release, Clemons was already well known nationally as the saxophonist in Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band. The song was released on Clemons' solo album Hero of that year. Browne's then- girlfriend Daryl Hannah provides background vocals and appears in the song's music video painting and later filming the duo. Also appearing in the video is a backing band, including songwriter Walden on drums. The 'B-Side' was a song called "Let the Music Say It" not included on the album Hero. "Let the Music Say It" was produced in 1985 and written by Clemons and Michael Jonzun. Bolstered by the enormous popularity of Springsteen at the time, the song was a success commercially, reaching the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 (#18), Mainstream Rock (#16), and the top 40 on the Adult Contemporary (#21) charts in the U.S. The song was named #100 on VH1's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the 80s in 2009. A live version of the song was recorded on Clemons' 2004 album with Temple of Soul entitled Live in Asbury Park, Vol. 2. This song was used by the World Wrestling Federation (WWE) in early 1986, to cement a storyline involving a feud between "Rowdy" Roddy Piper and "Ace" Cowboy Bob Orton, culminating with a montage of their work together from 1984-86. It was also used again on 02/03/1989 on NBC's "The Main Event" to show the close friendships of The Mega Powers- Hulk Hogan, Randy "Macho Man" Savage, and Miss Elizabeth. It was heard on the pilot episode of My Two Dads on NBC in 1987. ==Chart performance== {|class="wikitable sortable" ! Chart (1985-86) !
