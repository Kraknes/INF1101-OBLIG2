Eventually the school became Northeast High School. The auditorium was added in 1916. In 1936 vocational education shops and many regular classrooms were added to the original building. The graduating class of 1965 is believed to have suffered an unusually high number of casualties in the Vietnam war and was the subject of the 1995 documentary Yearbook: The Class of '65, directed by Stephen Jimenez. The school, still only for boys, was 80% African-American, 10% Anglo White, and 10% Puerto Rican in 1970.Suess, Gretchen Elise Leuszler (Temple University).

All of the trophies, most of the teaching staff and memorabilia were transferred to the new building. At the same time, a new school, Thomas Alva Edison High, was opened at the site. Because of the facilities, Edison remained all male until September 1979 when it became co-educational. In 1988, the original school was replaced by a co- educational Edison/Fareira High School, named in part for its late principal, John C. Fareira. The new Edison/Fareira is a combined academic high school and vocational skills center. It is located at Front & Luzerne Streets with an outdoor athletic facility on the same site.
