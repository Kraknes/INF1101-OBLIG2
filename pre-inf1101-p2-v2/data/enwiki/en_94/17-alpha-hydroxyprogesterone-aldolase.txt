In enzymology, a 17a-hydroxyprogesterone aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :17a-hydroxyprogesterone \rightleftharpoons androst-4-en-3,17-dione + acetaldehyde Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 17a-hydroxyprogesterone, and two products, androst-4-en-3,17-dione and acetaldehyde. This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 17a-hydroxyprogesterone acetaldehyde-lyase (4-androstene-3,17-dione-forming). Other names in common use include C-17/C-20-lyase, and 17a-hydroxyprogesterone acetaldehyde-lyase. This enzyme participates in androgen and estrogen metabolism. ==References== * Category:EC 4.1.2 Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
