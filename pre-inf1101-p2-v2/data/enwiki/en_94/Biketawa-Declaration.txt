The Biketawa Declaration is a declaration agreed to by all the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum constituting a framework for coordinating response to regional crises. The declaration was agreed to at the 31st Summit of Pacific Islands Forum Leaders, held at Kiribati in October 2000 in the regional context of the 2000 Fijian coup d'etat and ethnic tensions in the Solomon Islands. The Biketawa Declaration has led to military and police forces as well as civilian personnel of Forum states, chiefly Australia and New Zealand, participating in regional peacekeeping and stabilization operations in Solomon Islands (2003-), Nauru (2004-2009) and Tonga (2006). The Biketawa Declaration takes its name from the Kiribati islet of Biketawa, where the Forum Leaders met in a Retreat (by themselves) on the islet of Biketawa to discuss, agree and adopt the Biketawa Declaration. == References == == External links == * Question to the Foreign Minister * Biketawa Declaration Category:New Zealand-Pacific relations Category:Politics of Oceania Category:2000 in Oceania Category:2000 in Kiribati Category:2000 in international relations
