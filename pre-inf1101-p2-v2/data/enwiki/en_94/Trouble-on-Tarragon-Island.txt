Like the earlier novels in the series,Tarragon Island (1999) and No Cafes in Narnia (2000), Trouble on Tarragon Island is set on a small fictional island in the Gulf of Georgia off Canada's West Coast in British Columbia. The main character is Heather Blake, a budding writer, who has moved there from Toronto with her family and has difficulty adjusting to life in a small community. Heather's grandmother is the source of much controversy when she gets involved with a group of protesters called the Ladies of the Forest who oppose the logging of local old-growth trees. The conflict intensifies when arrests are made among the protesters and the situation escalates. The book confronts moral quandaries regarding the role of protesters, journalists, and government policies and explores the boundaries within these roles.
