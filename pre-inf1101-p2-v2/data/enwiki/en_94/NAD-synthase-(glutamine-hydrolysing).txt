In enzymology, a NAD+ synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :ATP + deamido-NAD+ \+ L-glutamine + H2O \rightleftharpoons AMP + diphosphate + NAD+ \+ L-glutamate. In eukaryotes, this enzyme contains a glutaminase domain related to nitrilase. The substrates of this enzyme are ATP, deamido-NAD+, L-glutamine, and H2O, whereas its 4 products are AMP, diphosphate, NAD+, and glutamate This enzyme participates in glutamate metabolism and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. == Nomenclature == This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds carbon-nitrogen ligases with glutamine as amido-N-donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is deamido- NAD+:L-glutamine amido-ligase (AMP-forming). Other names in common use include NAD+ synthetase (glutamine-hydrolysing), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthetase (glutamine), desamidonicotinamide adenine dinucleotide amidotransferase, and DPN synthetase. == References == Category:EC 6.3.5 Category:NADH-dependent enzymes Category:Enzymes of known structure
