M-phase inducer phosphatase 3 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the CDC25C gene. This gene is highly conserved during evolution and it plays a key role in the regulation of cell division. The encoded protein is a tyrosine phosphatase and belongs to the Cdc25 phosphatase family. It directs dephosphorylation of cyclin B-bound CDC2 (CDK1) and triggers entry into mitosis. It is also thought to suppress p53-induced growth arrest. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, however, the full-length nature of many of them is not known. ==Interactions== CDC25C has been shown to interact with MAPK14, CHEK1, PCNA, PIN1, PLK3 and NEDD4. ==See also== * Cdc25 ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== *
