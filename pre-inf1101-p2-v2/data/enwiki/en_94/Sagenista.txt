Sagenista is a group of heterokonts containing the labyrinthulids and Eogyrea, a class of yet uncultured protists. Originally, it contained the Labyrinthulids and bicosoecids. However at present the bicosoecids have been removed, and Eogyrea were added, in order to make the group monophyletic. Some have a special organelle called a bothrosome (or sagenogenetosome). It is usually found in a marine environments rich in algae and sea grass. It is capable of movement by use of this organelle. They are generally decomposers. They are cultivated for their active production of Omega-3 fatty acids. These acids are used as an approved additive for animal feed. There is a debate about whether some species of Sagenista contains a photosynthetic pigment labeled chlorophyll C. ==Bothrosome== They are capable of excreting an extoplasmic net of filaments for cells to glide upon. These tiny filaments provide a network for cells to travel upon to soak up nutrients from the surrounding environment. ==Examples== *Labyrinthula: Possesses a bothrosome. It is being studied for its pathogenic nature in marine environments. It has killed an entire species of Sea grass as well as some species, such as a particular snail that relies on the grass. ==References== ==Bibliography== * *General Mycology.
