Ofstead have consistently rated the school as requiring improvement. From Ofstead's 2018 report the school has the following: ===Strengths=== deg The headteacher, ably supported by senior leaders, governors and the trust, has navigated the school through difficult financial and staffing challenges well. The school is now stable and improving quickly. deg The school's curriculum, including the personal, social, health and careers education programme, is highly attuned to pupils' needs, and aspirations. deg Pupils' behaviour and conduct are good. They feel safe and well supported. deg Pupils' spiritual, moral, social and cultural understanding is commendable. deg Low-attaining pupils and pupils who speak English as an additional language make good progress. ===Weaknesses=== deg Since the last inspection, pupils' progress by the end of key stage 4 has been weaker in English, mathematics and science than in other subjects. deg Some pupils in key stage 4 have not benefited from improvements in teaching for long enough to tackle weaknesses in their knowledge, understanding and skills. deg Although pupils' progress in science overall has improved, their progress and attainment in the combined science qualification are too weak. This is due to gaps in pupils' knowledge caused by previous weak teaching. deg Leaders have managed a very turbulent staffing period very well since the last inspection but teaching in some areas of the school requires improvement. deg Some teachers do not have high enough expectations of pupils, especially boys and the most able. deg Teachers do not develop pupils' writing skills, effectively across the school. deg Not all teachers use pupils' support plans as well as they could to improve the progress of pupils who have special educational needs (SEN) and/or disabilities. deg While attendance in the sixth form is improving, some students do not attend school frequently enough. Some students do not complete the courses that they start. Those studying GCSE mathematics do not make as much progress as those who are studying for their English examinations. deg Some teachers do not insist that the most able complete the more challenging tasks which are routinely set. Consequently, these pupils do not practise writing in more depth, or thinking more deeply about the work that they do, often enough. This hinders their progress. deg While boys demonstrate confident oral skills in class, their written work does not reflect their understanding. Some teachers are not insistent enough that sufficient work is completed and to the required standard. Boys' performance, especially at key stage 4, lags behind that of girls in many subjects. deg Teachers' strategies to support pupils' writing skills are variable across the school. In some subjects and classes, pupils use their grammar, spelling and punctuation knowledge well to structure their writing accurately. Elsewhere, teachers provide little Inspection report: Childwall Sports and Science Academy, 6-7 June 2018 Page 6 of 14 or no guidance to develop pupils' writing. Consequently, pupils continue to make basic errors and do not build up the stamina to write at length. deg In previous years, too many students, especially those who are of low ability, dropped out of the courses that they had started. Too many did not continue into Year 13 from Year 12. While this year fewer students than previously did not pursue their original course and the number of students staying on to Year 13 increased, student retention and course completion remain issues for the school. deg While students' attendance to school has improved compared with previous years, it is still not high enough. ==History== ===Grammar school=== It was known as Holt High School on Queen's Drive.
