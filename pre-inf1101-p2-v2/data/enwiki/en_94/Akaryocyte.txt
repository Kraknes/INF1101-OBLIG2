Akaryocytes, also known as akaryotes or acaryotes, are cells without a nucleus. The name is derived from the Greek prefix "a-", meaning "without" and the Greek "karyo-", meaning "nut" or "kernel". Akaryocytes also include viruses since they lack a nucleus but have instead, a central core of RNA or DNA. Akaryocytes are not part of the seven main ranks of taxa. Akaryotes depend on other organisms for their existence and are able to grow and reproduce only in the cells of other organisms. They are non-cellular e.g. viruses. Akaryotes are nucleoprotien particles. Category:Cells
