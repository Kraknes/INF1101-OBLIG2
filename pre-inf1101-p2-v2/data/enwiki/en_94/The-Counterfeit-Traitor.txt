It was based on a nonfiction book of the same name by Alexander Klein. The film was directed by George Seaton. ==Plot== Erickson (Holden) is an American-born Swedish oil man who is pressured by Allied intelligence agents, led by a British agent (Griffith), to spy for the Allies. Erickson begins his job reluctantly, as it causes marital discord and forces him to pose as a Nazi. He agrees because otherwise his business would be destroyed by the Allies, but over time, realizes it is the right thing to do. He is influenced in making this moral decision by one of his contacts in Germany, a religious woman (Lilli Palmer) who gives him guidance on the meaning of life and right and wrong. Erickson has a number of close calls, but eventually escapes to Sweden in a harrowing sea voyage. ==Cast== * William Holden - Eric Erickson * Lilli Palmer - Frau Marianne Mollendorf * Hugh Griffith - Collins * Carl Raddatz - Otto Holtz * Ulf Palme - Max Gumpel * Ernst Schroder - Baron Gerhard von Oldenburg * Charles Regnier - Wilhelm Kortner * Ingrid van Bergen - Hulda Windler * Helo Gutschwager - Hans Holtz * Wolfgang Preiss - Colonel Nordoff * Werner Peters - Bruno Ulrich * Erica Beer - Klara Holtz * Stefan Schnabel - Gestapo agent at funeral * Klaus Kinski - Kindler, Jewish Refugee * Jochen Blume - Dr. Jacob Karp * Erik Schumann - Nazi Gunboat Officer * Dirk Hansen - Lieutenant Nagler * Poul Reichhardt - Fishing Boat Skipper * Ludwig Naybert - Stationmaster * Louis Miehe-Renard - Poul * Kai Holm - Gunnar * Jens Osterholm - Lars * Eva Dahlbeck - Ingrid Erickson ==See also== * List of American films of 1962 * Eric Erickson, the real-life spy on whom the book and film are based ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1962 films Category:1960s war drama films Category:1960s spy films Category:1960s thriller drama films Category:American spy films Category:American films Category:American thriller drama films Category:American war drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films about Nazi Germany Category:Films based on biographies Category:Films scored by Alfred Newman Category:Films directed by George Seaton Category:Films set in the Baltic Sea Category:Films set in Denmark Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:World War II spy films Category:1962 drama films
