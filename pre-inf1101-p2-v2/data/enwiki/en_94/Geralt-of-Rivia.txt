Geralt of Rivia () is a fictional character and the protagonist of The Witcher series of short stories and novels by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. Geralt, one of the few remaining witchers on the Continent, is a traveling monster slayer for hire, mutated and trained from an early age to slay deadly beasts. Geralt is portrayed by Michal Zebrowski in The Hexer film and TV series, while Henry Cavill portrayed the character in Netflix The Witcher series. ==Fictional biography== ===Novels=== Geralt is a witcher. Shortly after being born, Geralt's mother, Visenna, gave him away to undergo training and, eventually, become a witcher at Kaer Morhen - the stronghold of the witchers. Geralt survived mutations during the Trial of the Grasses, thanks to which he gained various witcher traits: high resistance to injury, poison and disease, slowed ageing, but also infertility. He resisted the "changes" brought on by the Trial of Grasses better than most, which encouraged his makers to perform even more dangerous experimental procedures on him, making him lose all body pigmentation. Because of his pale skin and white hair, he is also known in the Elder Speech as "Gwynbleidd" (close to the Welsh translation "Blaidd Gwyn"), the White Wolf. From the arduous training of Witchers, he became a master swordfighter and learnt how to use the Signs, simple spells used by the witchers. Despite his name, Geralt does not come from Rivia (although he learned how to mimic a Rivian accent and is later knighted for services to the queen of Rivia): young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir, to make their names sound more trustworthy. He once claimed that his first choice was Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde, but this was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious. After completing his witcher training, he received his Wolf medallion (the symbol of Kaer Morhen) and embarked into the world on his horse called Plotka (literally, "Roach" ; he gave the same name to every horse he owned) to become a monster slayer for hire. Even though Geralt did not believe in destiny, he unknowingly demanded the unborn child of princess Pavetta and her husband Duny as a reward for his services by invoking "the Law of Surprise". The child turned out to be a girl, Cirilla, commonly known as Ciri; since then the two are linked to each other. At first, Geralt did not take her because women cannot become witchers. However, fate caused Geralt and Ciri to cross their paths thrice, with him claiming her for a second time when he invokes the Law of Surprise on a traveling merchant he saves from monsters during a random encounter; and after the death of her grandmother, Queen Calanthe of Cintra, Geralt ends up taking the girl into his care, training and loving her as his own daughter. Following the short stories, the novels unfold as Geralt is pulled into a whirlwind of events in his attempts to protect Ciri from those who would do her harm, becoming reluctantly embroiled in the political contentions of monarchs and emperors. ===Video games=== Geralt's adventures continue in a non-canonical version by CD Projekt Red's video game trilogy (The Witcher, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt), where he is still alive after being killed by a mob during an anti non-human riot at the end of the Witcher novel saga and his body was taken in a boat by his daughter Ciri to Avalon. The third installment of the trilogy, like its predecessors, follows Geralt through his final adventures. Following the events of Witcher 2, Geralt has regained his memory of the past and prepares to embark on a new journey. In the Witcher 3, Geralt is on the hunt for the only person he considers kin, Ciri. Along his journey, Geralt must face the Wild Hunt in order to protect the people he cares about. In the new open world, Geralt has the opportunity to complete quests that are both part of the main story and side quests. He will also interact with old friends Dandelion and Vesemir along with potential lovers Triss Merigold and Yennefer. Sapkowski stated that the games are a work of art of their own and that they cannot be considered either an "alternative version", or a sequel, "because this can only be told by Geralt's creator. A certain Andrzej Sapkowski." ===Television=== ====Hexer (2002)==== ====The Witcher (2019)==== ==Literary analysis and reception == Geralt is described as being emblematic of Polish popular culture's spirit of "neo-liberal anti- politics" in the 1990s. He is a professional, carrying out his duties and unwilling to become involved in the "petty quarrels" of the contemporary politics. Marek Oramus compared Geralt to Raymond Chandler's signature character Philip Marlowe. In 2018, GamesRadar ranked him as the 6th best hero in video game history. In 2018, Geralt was included in Tom's Guide Top 25 Best Video Game Characters of All Time. ==In other media== === Film === Michal Zebrowski portrays Geralt in the Polish-language adaptation movie The Hexer. ===Television=== Michal Zebrowski reprised his role from the film to portray Geralt in the polish-language adaptation series The Hexer that came out in 2002. Henry Cavill portrays Geralt in the Netflix adaptation of the books, the first season of which was released in December 2019. Sapkowski served as a creative consultant on the project. ===Video games=== Geralt, voiced by Doug Cockle, appeared as a guest character in the 2018 game Soulcalibur VI. Geralt also appeared in special content for Monster Hunter: World and Daemon X Machina. ==See also== * List of characters in The Witcher series * Reynevan ==References== Category:The Witcher Category:Characters in fantasy novel series Category:Fantasy video game characters Category:Fantasy film characters Category:Literary characters introduced in 1986 Category:Fictional characters who use magic Category:Fictional characters with accelerated healing Category:Fictional characters with albinism Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength Category:Fictional knights Category:Fictional mutants Category:Fictional monster hunters Category:Fictional swordsmen Category:Soulcalibur series guest characters Category:Fictional characters with slowed ageing
