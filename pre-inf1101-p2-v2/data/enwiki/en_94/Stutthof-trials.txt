Stutthof trials were a series of war crime tribunals held in postwar Poland for the prosecution of Stutthof concentration camp staff and officials, responsible for the murder of up to 85,000 prisoners during the occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany in World War II.Bogdan Chrzanowski, Andrzej Gasiorowski (Zeszyty Muzeum, 5), Zaloga obozu Stutthof (Staff of Stutthof concentration camp) (PDF file, direct download 9.14 MB) p. 189 (13/40 in PDF). Muzeum Stutthof w Sztutowie. Zaklad Narodowy Imienia Ossolinskich, Wroclaw, Warszawa, Krakow 1984. PL ISSN 0137-5377. None of the Stutthof commandants were ever tried in Poland. SS-Sturmbannfuhrer Max Pauly was sentenced to death in Germany but not for the crimes committed at Stutthof; only as the commandant of the Neuengamme concentration camp in Hamburg. The first Polish war crimes tribunal was convened at Gdansk, Poland, from April 25, 1946 to May 31, 1946. The next three trials took place at the same court in 8-31 October 1947, 5-10 November, and in 19-29 November of that year. The fifth trial was held before the court in Torun in 1949. The sixth and the last Stutthof trial in Poland took place in 1953 also in Gdansk. In total, of the approximately 2,000 SS men and women who ran the entire camp complex, 72 SS officers and six female overseers were brought to justice. ==First Stutthof trial== During the first war crimes tribunal held at Gdansk from April 25, 1946, to May 31, 1946, the joint Soviet/Polish Special Criminal Court tried and convicted of crimes against humanity a group of thirteen ex-officials and overseers of the Stutthof concentration camp in Sztutowo and its Bromberg-Ost subcamp for women located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The accused were arraigned before the court and all found guilty. Twelve were sentenced to death, including the commander of the guards Johann Pauls, while the remainder were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. The death sentences were carried out on July 4, 1946 at the Biskupia Gorka in Gdansk, by short-drop hanging.Skalman.nu Forum, Stutthof Trial, April 25-May 31, 1946 at JewishVirtualLibrary.org The commandant of the Stutthof and Neuengamme concentration camps SS-Sturmbannfuhrer Max Pauly was sentenced to death in Germany at about the same time. Pauly was tried by the British for war crimes with thirteen others in the Curio Haus in Hamburg which was located in the British occupied sector of Germany. The trial lasted from March 18, 1946 to May 13, 1946. He was found guilty and sentenced to death with 11 other defendants.

In 2017, the prosecution of two former Stutthof camp guards from Borken and Wuppertal commenced. The Wuppertal accused denied the allegations and declared that he was not present during the killings, and did not notice anything about it. In November 2018, Johann Rehbogen from Borken was tried in court for serving at Stutthof camp from June 1942 to September 1944.
