He explained that he had badly misunderstood, but still got 30 million Vietnam Dong fine, the production company was fined 23 million Vietnamdong and the album was withdrawn from the shelf. In the album Mr. Dam (2005), the song Em Da Quen Mot Dong Song was printed on the cover to be allegedly composed by songwriter Hai Trieu, actually this is a song by Vietnamese-American songwriter Truc Ho without his permission. Thuy Nga Center was the official representative for the release of this album, but Em Da Quen Mot Dong Song was cut out. Also in this album, Bac Tinh was a song by Vietnamese-American songwriter Huynh Nhat Tan, but it was printed to belong to songwriter Nhat Dang Khoa on the cover. === Feud with singer Phuong Thanh === Before the news which singer Phuong Thanh was blackmailed, he'd had a close friendship with Phuong Thanh. After this incident, Phuong Thanh came to meet him in person and said: "In this case, I only doubt Ngoc and Hung". Dam Vinh Hung also confirmed this news however he'd falsely assumed that Phuong Thanh was talking about singer Hong Ngoc and Tuan Hung. In 2007, when the feud between Phuong Thanh and journalist Huong Tra was sent to the court, it was reported that Dam Vinh Hung sent his lawyer to assist Huong Tra. In 2008, both admitted to haven't talked for more than 1 year. During this time, Phuong Thanh shared that there must be someone close to her, had sold out her personal life to the press to write many tabloids regarding her life. Other than that, the news about Dam Vinh Hung were published at the same time of Phuong Thanh's saying constantly added more tensions to their friendship. Answering many speculations, he addressed that there were only misunderstanding and hopefully everything would be rightfully revealed. However, Phuong Thanh accused that the friendship "was doomed". In Green Waves Award 2012, they made it up. === Attack in America (2010) === 18 July 2010, he was attacked by Ly Tong while performing at Santa Clara Conference Center, California, USA. Afterward, middle aged and elder audiences didn't approve his appearance at the music show, there were protests and many plans put out to pressure the organizers to cancel any show that Dam Ving Hung involved. According to Mercurynews, many supported Ly Tong, even local politicians, demanded to release him immediately. Ly Tong hoped that the jury wouldn't accuse him of having violent intention, based on his excuse as he "protected Vietnamese community from the representative of the Communist regime". However, he was still accused of being guilty and had to serve 6 months in jail and another 3 years under control. The incident which Dam Vinh Hung was heavily protested by Vietnamese Community in the US due to they viewed him as someone who propagandizes the Government of Vietnam. He was previously honored by the Government of Vietnam for performing multiple political songs while waving Vietnam national flag which happened to be hated by American- Vietnamese. Moreover, his statement for Ly Tong as "I'm willing to forgive" was considered to be provocative. === Feud with Thanh Lam === Singer Thanh Lam negatively commented on how Dam Vinh Hung and Ho Ngoc Ha were the judges of The Voice Vietnam 2012: "While watching The Voice, I was surprised and couldn't imagine myself that Dam Vinh Hung, Ho Ngoc Ha would be the judge, what are they going to teach the contestants though?". On 21 August 2012, he declared: "I'm not fake, neither pretending nor keeping silence on the matter. If you know how important your image is then everyone else does. Please end this relationship immediately. Stop meeting each other from now on". Thanh Lam and Dam Vinh Hung later due to conflicts had been avoiding each other ever since although they perform on the same stage. Previously, he had often stated that Thanh Lam was his idol. === Kissing a monk in 2012 === During the auction as a contribution for charity foundation for Wanbi Tuan Anh at Khong Ten Music Tearoom on 4 November 2012, he brought a bottle of wine on stage for auctioning along the declaration: The winner will bring the bottle of wine home and my two kisses". As the result, the winner was two monks for auctioning the bottle of wine for 55 million Vietnamdong. Afterward, he kissed one of two monks on the lips and kissed the hand of the older monk. The monks later were fined from the higher monks for 3 months under control. The younger monk who kissed Dam Vinh Hung on the lip later deconsecrated due to family circumstance and his will was accepted. In the letter to the press in 9 November, Dam Vinh Hung sent an apology to the audiences and monks. On 14 November 2012, the inspector of Vietnam's bureau of culture, sport and tourism invited him to Ha Noi for reporting, then fined him for 5 million Vietnam Dong for hi previous action toward the monk which was considered to be offensive. Later, another letter from Dam Vinh Hung allegedly, he revealed that the monk was the one who wanted to do the kiss and some negative accusations about this monk. However, after deconsecration, the monk stated that Dam Vinh Hung was the one who ignited it and denied all the false accusations from Dam Vinh Hung. === Porridge business === His company (appear to be Joint Stock Company Song Kim) lost a law court for the trading of the brand "Chao Cay Thi". Therefore, the company must return 1,5 billion Vietnam Dong for the trading previously. Up to now, his business didn't gain much success. === Incident with songwriter-composer Nguyen Anh 9 (2013) === In August 2013, during an interview, composer Nguyen Anh 9 frankly commented on Dam Vinh Hung as he stated that: "His voice is half Southern-half Northern, he has no techniques and style in singing whatsoever. In the past, he could only be C list singer as a back up singer, not the main singer of tearooms at all" "Dam Vinh Hung only own polished outside, I don't consider him as a true singer" (Nguyen Anh 9) Artist Tran Hieu said: "We need someone to wake up everyone on the reality of Vietnam music industry nowadays like composer Nguyen Anh 9. If we keep complimenting this and that singer then Vietnam music industry will be hollow". For those comments, he also gave an aggressive flashback on his Facebook page, in which he assumed composer Nguyen Anh 9 was only a person wearing a mask, that the composer's comment was offensive towards his achievement throughout the years as well as his fans. "I promise you that from now on, I will never sing any of your songs although you had never said anything like the statement in the interview "please don't perform my songs" (Dam Vinh Hung). The statement was considered to be "ungraceful" and provoked disapproval from other artists and the press. Many readers said that his behavior is impolite. Composer Nguyen Anh 9 on the other hand, felt funny when reading Hung's letter, as he replied: "If you want to fight back, you need to be polite first". === The incident at General Vo Nguyen Giap's funeral === On 6 October 2013, instead of queuing to visit General Vo Nguyen Giap's funeral, he and his assistant entered the funeral zone without queuing like others. He got the privilege to visit first in the surprise of many military veterans and Vietnam citizens. Answering the journalist of Dat Viet Newspaper, the security guard at the funeral said that: "Before the visit, he had already called for permission". == Singles == On 18 April 2012, Dam released his first single - Tuoi Hong Tho Ngay. The uniqueness in the products of Mr. Dam is out of a record-length 16 min 45 sec, music video "Tuoi Hong Tho Ngay" is more like a short film with the complete story.
