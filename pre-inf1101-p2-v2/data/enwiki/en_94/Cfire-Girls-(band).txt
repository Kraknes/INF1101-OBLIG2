Campfire Girls is a U.S. rock band from Los Angeles, California. The band formed in 1993 in Hollywood, California. Less than a year after forming, the band signed a Major Label deal with Interscope Records. This deal would lead to the release of an EP, Mood Enhancer (1995). Soon after the band members developed drug problems which resulted in the band being dropped from the label, and the group disbanded. Years later, a new version of Campfire Girls emerged. Its debut album Delongpre (2002) is composed mostly of demo versions of the songs intended for the band's first full-length album, using recordings that were done in the mid-'90s. The album's name is the Hollywood street where the band had lived and recorded. A third release, Tell Them Hi (2003), received some critical praise, but their popularity did not reach critical mass. ==Members== *Christian Stone - vocals, guitar *Mike Semple - guitar *Jon Pikus - drums *Andrew Clark - bass ==Discography== * Mood Enhancer (1995, EP) * Delongpre (2002) * Tell Them Hi (2003) ==External links== * [ Campfire Girls entry] at AllMusic Category:Alternative rock groups from California Category:American post-grunge musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1993 Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles Category:1993 establishments in California Category:Pop punk groups from California
