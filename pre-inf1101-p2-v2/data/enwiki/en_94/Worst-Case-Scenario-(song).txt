"Worst Case Scenario" is the third single by the English indie band The Hoosiers from their 2007 #1 album The Trick to Life. It has been admitted by lead man Irwin on the band's website that it is one of the band's favourite songs. ==History== The song received its first airplay on Radio 1 and the single was released 7 January 2008. However, it made a surprisingly disappointing impact in the UK Singles Chart. After The Hoosiers had already had two UK Top 5 singles, this single was to miss the UK Top 75 altogether, only peaking just outside that area at #76. However, the single's release also boosted The Trick to Life back into the UK Top 5 in the UK Albums Chart on 27 January 2008. The video shows the band playing in a dark wooden cabin where things aren't as they seem. The song is about being in love with being miserable. ==Chart positions== {| class="wikitable" !align="left"|Chart (2008) !align="left"|Peak position |- |align="left"|UK Singles Chart |align="center"|76 |- |} ==Track listing== #Worst Case Scenario #Ruby Blue ==References== Category:The Hoosiers songs Category:2007 songs Category:2008 singles Category:RCA Records singles Category:Song articles with missing songwriters
