Skaraborg Air Force Wing (), also F 7 Satenas, or simply F 7, is a Swedish Air Force wing with the main base located near Lidkoping in south-central Sweden. ==History== The decision to set up the air wing was made in 1936, but disagreements in choosing a location delayed the commissioning. The Satenas estate was chosen for its good location and close proximity to suitable target ranges, and was purchased for 685,000 Swedish krona in 1938. The first squadrons were set up with B 16A Caproni purchased from Italy at the start of World War II. These wooden framed aircraft were not suitable for the Nordic climate and soon got the nickname "flying coffins". They were replaced in 1941 by the Swedish B 17A that served throughout the war. In 1946, the three bomber squadrons were converted to attack squadrons with the introduction of A 21, although for a brief number of years between 1948-1951, B 18 medium bombers were transferred from the Vastmanland Air Force Wing (F 1). The wing converted to jet aircraft in 1951 receiving A 21R converted from fighter to attack role from the Scania Air Force Wing (F 10). These were only kept for three years until the introduction of A 29B Tunnan in 1954. After only two years, they were in turn replaced by the new A 32A in 1956. In 1964, a new transport squadron was set up with the introduction of the Tp 84 Hercules. Initially, only one aircraft was purchased, but a total of eight were introduced between 1965 and 1985. They are currently being used in international transport of Swedish Armed Forces. The first example acquired (84001) was withdrawn from use on 9 June 2014, with the second scheduled to follow within the year. In 1973 the AJ 37 Viggen replaced the A 32, and the number of attack squadrons was reduced from three to two. The Viggens served until 1993, when one squadron was converted to the new JAS 39 Gripen. The second squadron followed suit in 1998. F 7 is the main center for the entire Gripen system, and all training of pilots (including that of foreign operators) is carried out here. ==Barracks and training areas== ===Barracks=== The former privately owned estate Tun in Satenas on the southeastern part of Lake Vanern was purchased by the state in 1938. Later, additional land was purchased. The wing has two crossing runways.
