Monk Fryston is a small village and civil parish in the Selby district of North Yorkshire, England. ==History and overview== The Dictionary of British Place Names notes Monk Fryston as "Fristun" (c.1030) and "Munechesfryston" (1166). The name derives from the Old English for "farmstead of the frisians", with prefix 'Monk' relating to it being an 11th-century possession of Selby Abbey.Mills, Anthony David (2003); A Dictionary of British Place Names, Oxford University Press, revised edition (2011), p.197. According to a personal FreeUK web page, the name of the village originates from Monk's Free Stone as all of the stone used to build Selby Abbey was obtained from a quarry in the centre of the village across the road from the old school building. The quarry was filled in for a housing development located next to the new school building, built on the old school field in 1998-99. The old school building has since been converted to housing.
