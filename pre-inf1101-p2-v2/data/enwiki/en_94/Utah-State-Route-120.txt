From there, the route heads east on 1200 South, a four-lane undivided highway, in the southwestern portion of Richfield. The road continues east for ten blocks before turning northeast on Main Street, a four-lane road, and beginning an overlap with SR-118 (the former routing of US 89). Past 900 South, the road straightens out to the north and reaches central Richfield. At 300 North, SR-118 branches off to the east and SR-120 continues north on Main Street.

All of SR-120/I-70 Business is included in the National Highway System. ==History== State Route 120 was established in 1969 as a road looping around I-70 in Richfield. The route was initially composed of three portions: a proposed road from the under-construction interchange at I-70 in southeast Richfield to Main Street, the existent portion of Main Street (then a part of US 89) north to 300 North, and another proposed road connecting this point to the north Richfield interchange. The proposed roads were completed in 1990, with the overlapping portion of US 89 along Main Street rerouted onto I-70 in 1992. No realignments have affected the route since then.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated October 2007, accessed August 2008 ==Major intersections== ==References== 120 120 Category:Streets in Utah
