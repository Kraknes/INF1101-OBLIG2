In enzymology, a phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :ATP + N2-formyl-N1-(5-phospho-D- ribosyl)glycinamide + L-glutamine + H2O \rightleftharpoons ADP + phosphate + 2-(formamido)-N1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)acetamidine + L-glutamate The 4 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, N2-formyl-N1-(5-phospho-D- ribosyl)glycinamide, L-glutamine, and H2O, whereas its 4 products are ADP, phosphate, 2-(formamido)-N1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)acetamidine, and L-glutamate. This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds carbon-nitrogen ligases with glutamine as amido-N-donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N2-formyl-N1-(5-phospho-D- ribosyl)glycinamide:L-glutamine amido-ligase (ADP-forming). Other names in common use include phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthetase, formylglycinamide ribonucloetide amidotransferase, phosphoribosylformylglycineamidine synthetase, FGAM synthetase, FGAR amidotransferase, 5'-phosphoribosylformylglycinamide:L-glutamine amido-ligase, (ADP-forming), 2-N-formyl-1-N-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)glycinamide:L-glutamine, and amido-ligase (ADP-forming). This enzyme participates in purine metabolism. The results of a recent study indicate that the ERK2 signaling activated by growth and oncogenic signals leads to PFAS phosphorylation at the T619 site. In addition, ERK2-mediated PFAS phosphorylation is required for cell and tumor growth. It is known as ADE6 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) genetics. ==Structural studies== As of late 2007, 8 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , and . ==References== Category:EC 6.3.5 Category:Enzymes of known structure
