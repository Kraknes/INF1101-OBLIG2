An araba in Wallachia An araba (from "araba." Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary. MICRA, Inc. 28 Feb. 2009.) (also arba or aroba) is a carriage (such as a cabriolet or coach), wagon or cart drawn by horses or oxen, used in Turkey and neighboring countries. It is usually heavy and without springs (when it has springs it is called yayli, shorter form of "yayli araba" or "araba with springs") and often covered. In modern Turkish, the word araba is used for almost any kind of wheeled device (for eg. el arabasi = hand car/trolley). It is also used for a car (automobile). ==Notes== ==References== *Araba Clipart. Educational Technology Clearinghouse, University of South Florida.
