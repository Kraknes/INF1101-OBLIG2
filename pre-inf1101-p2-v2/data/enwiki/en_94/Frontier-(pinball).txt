Frontier is a Bally pinball machine (produced under the Bally name) released in November 1980. It is based on the mountain man and hunting theme. ==Gameplay== ===Den of Predators and Frontier Bonus=== The basic game play is to collect two separate bonuses. The Den of Predators are 5 rows of 3 animals, rolling over lanes A, B and C or hitting the left, center, or right stationary targets lights one animal in the left, center, or right columns respectively. Lighting a complete row of animals advances the "Frontier Bonus". Lighting all the animals advances the "Frontier Bonus" to 60,000 and the "Predator Bonus" to 45,000 and lights "Special". ===Grizzly Target=== 3 in-line drop targets lead the way to the Grizzly Target, increasing the Frontier bonus multiplier. The first drop target also opens the gate to "Frontier Falls". ===Right drop targets=== The bank of drop target on the right of the pinball machine increase the "Den of Predators" multiplier. They also control targets for "Specials" and awards for "Specials". ===Frontier Falls=== Frontier Falls is a saucer accessed by first opening a gate activated by hitting the Grizzly Targets. Getting the ball into Frontier Falls collects the current Frontier Bonus. ==Playfield features== * 2 Flippers * 2 Slingshots * 3 Pop bumpers * 3 Bank drop targets * 3 In-line drop targets * 4 Stationary targets * Rollunder spinner * Saucer Kick-out hole ==External links== * Category:1980 pinball machines Category:Bally pinball machines
