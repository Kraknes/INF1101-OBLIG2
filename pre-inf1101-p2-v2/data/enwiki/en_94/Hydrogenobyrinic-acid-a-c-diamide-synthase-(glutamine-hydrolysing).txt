In enzymology, a hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide synthase (glutamine- hydrolysing) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :2 ATP + hydrogenobyrinic acid + 2 L-glutamine + 2 H2O \rightleftharpoons 2 ADP + 2 phosphate + hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide + 2 L-glutamate The four substrates of this enzyme are ATP, hydrogenobyrinic acid, L-glutamine, and H2O; its four products are ADP, phosphate, hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide, and L-glutamate. This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds carbon-nitrogen ligases with glutamine as amido-N-donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is hydrogenobyrinic- acid:L-glutamine amido-ligase (AMP-forming). This enzyme is also called CobB and is part of the biosynthetic pathway to cobalamin (vitamin B12) in aerobic bacteria. ==See Also== * Cobalamin biosynthesis ==References== * * Category:EC 6.3.5 Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
