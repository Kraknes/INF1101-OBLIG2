In March 2012, new research on Keats's ode 'To Autumn', co-authored with Dr Jayne Archer and Professor Howard Thomas (Aberystwyth University), was widely reported. Archival discoveries suggested that the 'stubble-plains' of Keats's ode 'To Autumn' were located on St Giles's Hill, to the east of the City of Winchester, with implications for a new political reading of the poem. The part of St Giles's Hill in question now lies under a multi-storey car park.Guardian newspaper feature.Oxford University Press blog.Southern Daily Echo.
