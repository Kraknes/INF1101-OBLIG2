Starting in 1997, the Royal Canadian Mint started to sell hockey medallions to the public. To commemorate the induction of Mario Lemieux in the Hockey Hall of Fame, a set was issued honouring all three inductees. One set was issued in Sterling Silver while another was issued in Nickel. The success of the release led to future issues. As a way of commemorating the retirement of Wayne Gretzky, a medallion was issued with a mintage of over 50,000. The medallions were $9.95 each and they were packaged in a blue sleeve with the number 99 in red on the packaging. ==Hockey medallions== ===Canada Post=== Starting in 2000, a series of stamps was issued to commemorate the All-Star Game in Toronto. The success of the series led to future stamp releases. Starting in 2001, the stamps were issued in a special collectors set. The stamps were packaged in a hard plastic case, with a hockey puck and corresponding medallions. These medallions were struck by the Royal Canadian Mint. {|class="wikitable sortable" !Year of issue !Theme !Players !Issue price |- |2001 |NHL All-Stars |Jean Beliveau, Eddie Shore, Terry Sawchuk, Denis Potvin, Bobby Hull, Syl Apps |N/A |- |2002 |NHL All-Stars | Tim Horton, Guy Lafleur, Howie Morenz, Glenn Hall, Red Kelly, Phil Esposito Canada Post Corporation.

This event will take place in Ottawa from December 26, 2008 to January 5, 2009. For the IIHF World Junior Hockey Championship medals, which were designed in collaboration with the IIHF and Hockey Canada, the Mint cut each blank - which is a medal without a design - out of copper. After the distinctive Ottawa design was struck onto each blank twice on a manual press using several tons of pressure, the medals were given their distinguishing finish: the coveted championship medals are plated with 24kt gold while the second-place medals are silver-plated and the third-place medals are finished with a warm bronze tone. All medals are lacquered and bear a Maple Leaf which is coloured with red enamel.http://www.mint.ca/store/news/royal-canadian-mint- produces-medals-for-2009-iihf-world-junior-hockey- championship-4400006?cat=News+releases&nId;=700002&parentnId;=600004&nodeGroup;=About+the+Mint The Mint also sourced the tournament's popular Player of the Game award, which this year is a uniquely Canadian-made acrylic and aluminum Hoselton sculpture, housed in a cherry wood box. ==Test tokens== ===One Cent Test Tokens=== {|class="wikitable" !Year of Issue !Description !Weight !Diameter !Thickness !Edge |- |1976The Charlton Standard Catalogue of Canadian Coins, 60th Anniversary Edition, 2006, p.230, by W.K.
