The LS-1200 is a diesel-electric switching locomotive built between May 1950 and August 1951, by Lima Locomotive Works of Lima, Ohio, United States. Lima's original design was the LS-1000, a 1,000 hp (750 kW) switcher, which became the standard for Lima's designs. A 660 hp (490 kW) switcher had also been designed, but none were built. By changing fuel rack settings, the LS-1000 was upgraded to the LS-1200, producing 1,200 horsepower (890 kW) from a turbocharged Hamilton T-89-SA four-stroke, eight cylinder inline diesel engine, a Westinghouse generator and 4 Westinghouse traction motors provided the 74,508 lbf (331.43 kN) of tractive effort. Lima-Hamilton did not assign model numbers to their models but referred to them by specification numbers. Model designations such as LS-1200 were a railfan invention. Lima-Hamilton assigned A-3170 as the specification number for this particular unit. == Original owners == {|class="wikitable" !Owner !Quantity !Road Numbers |- |Armco Steel |3 |710, E109, E110 |- |Baltimore & Ohio Railroad |24 |320-329, 340-353 |- |Erie Railroad |6 |660-665 |- |Chicago River and Indiana Railroad (New York Central Railroad) |6 |8406-8411 |- |New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad |10 |630-639 |- |New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (Nickel Plate Road) |4 |309-312 |- |Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis |6 |1200-1205 |- |Wabash Railroad |10 |401-406, 408-411 |- ! !! 69 !! |- |} ==Preservation== Two LS1200 are preserved: *ARMCO Steel E-110, the final locomotive produced by Lima- Hamilton, at the Illinois Railway Museum. *Baltimore and Ohio 320, at the Whitewater Valley Railroad. == References == * * * Category:Lima diesel locomotives Category:B-B locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1950 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the United States Category:Baltimore and Ohio locomotives Category:Erie Railroad locomotives Category:New York Central Railroad locomotives Category:New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad locomotives Category:Nickel Plate Road locomotives
