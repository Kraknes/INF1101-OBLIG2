Webb had appeared in Morecambe and Wise sketches starting in 1964. Her first appearance as "the lady who comes on at the end" was non-speaking in the 1969 second series. Her part was later expanded to a talking role, her line was nearly always: The farewell speech would be followed by gifts such as flowers, boxes of chocolates and the like.
