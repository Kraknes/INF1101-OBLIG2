Kyambura Gorge in Kasese western Uganda Kyambura Game Reserve or Chambura Game Reserve, which includes the Kyambura Gorge, is part of the Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP) in Uganda. It is home to a variety of wildlife, including the only primates in the Queen Elizabeth National Park. The area is an important water source for many animals and is surrounded by savanna, but is generally noted for its high concentration of primate life located in the gorge. ==History== Kyambura Game Reserve was formed to serve as a buffer zone to the Queen Elizabeth National Park. == Location == Kyambura is located on north-eastern side of QENP, approximately 30 km from QENP Headquarters. Kyambura Gorge spans a distance of 11 km and links to the Kazinga Channel, which forms the northern boundary of the reserve. Village and plantations lie to the south. The reserve's mean altitude is 1100 m.a.s.l. The total area of the reserve is 156 sq. km. ==Habitats== A total of 13 habitats have been recorded in the reserve. == Wildlife == Kyambura is the only place in QENP where habituated chimpanzees and other types of primates including red-tailed monkey, black-and-white colobus, baboons and vervet monkeys are seen. The park is also known for its variety of avian species including various falcons, the blue-headed bee-eater and the African finfoot. However, Chimpanzee Tracking is what draws visitors to the gorge. The Chimps in Kyambura Gorge were isolated after a forest corridor leading to larger forests like Kalinzu and Maramagambo were destroyed. Conservationists are worried that this could lead to inbreeding and mutations. Chimpanzee tracking in Kyambura Gorge is organized in two sessions. While tracking the chimps, visitors are treated to amazing views of the underground forest, birds and smaller primates. == References == Category:National parks of Uganda
