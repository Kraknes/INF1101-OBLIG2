The Jealous Girlfriends is a rock band based in Brooklyn, New York. Their music video for "How Now", directed by Sarah Soquel Morhaim, won first place for the iPod Music Video Contest. ==Biography== Courtesy Bob Sanderson The band was formed in 2003 by Holly Miranda (vocals/guitar) and Alex Lipsen (keys/synth/bass module). Josh Abbott (guitar/vocals) joined the band as their drummer. Soon after joining, Abbott began singing back up and before long, writing and sharing lead vocal duties with Miranda. In early 2005, they invited Mike Fadem (drums) to replace Abbott on drums so that the latter could move up front to focus on singing and add another guitar to their live sound. They first released an 8-track album titled Comfortably Uncomfortable. The song "Lay Around" played on the Showtime series the L Word. In 2007, they released a self-titled second album, recorded with Dan Long at Headgear Studio in Brooklyn. "Roboxulla" and "Something in the Water" were used on the ABC series Grey's Anatomy, while "Carry Me" was featured on CSI: Miami. In April 2008, they opened for Nada Surf. ==Discography== * Comfortably Uncomfortable (2005) * The Jealous Girlfriends (2007) ==References== ==External links== * Official Myspace *Jealous Girlfriends on Billboard.com *Jealous Girlfriends on TheDeliMagazine.com *Jealous Girlfriends (interview) Category:Rock music groups from New York (state) Category:Musical groups from Brooklyn Category:Musical groups established in 2003 Category:2003 establishments in New York City
