The Cardinal Handicap is an American Thoroughbred horse race run annually at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky during its fall meet. The Grade III Cardinal is open to fillies and mares three-years-old and up and set at a distance of one and one eighth mile on the turf. At its current distance of nine furlongs, Miss Caerleona holds the record of 1:47.81. The 2017 edition of the race, won by Tricky Escape, was run on dirt as the turf course was deemed unfit for racing. The race's Gr.III status was kept for 2017. It currently offers a purse of $100,000. ==Past winners== * 2017 - Tricky Escape (4) (Christopher P.
