The Greatest Hits Collection is a Bananarama videos compilation released by London Records in 1988, as a companion video to their Greatest Hits album. The video differs slightly from the album -- "More Than Physical" is not included on the album; the video to "Love in the First Degree" includes group live performance from 1988 BRIT awards (last performance ever with Fahey); and "Mr. Sleaze" is actually the B-side to "Love in the First Degree", and the video includes images from old Bananarama videos, while both songs and videos for either "I Want You Back" and "Love, Truth & Honesty" feature new member Jacquie O'Sullivan. The video for "Nathan Jones" was not included at the time of release. ==Track listing== Multimix includes #"Cruel Summer" #"Na Na Hey Hey (Kiss Him Goodbye)" #:Directed by Keef #"Shy Boy" #:Directed by Midge Ure & Chris Cross #"Robert De Niro's Waiting..." #:Directed by Duncan Gibbins #"Really Saying Something" #:Directed by Midge Ure & Chris Cross #"Venus" (12" Mix) #:Directed by Peter Care #"More Than Physical" (UK Single Version) #:Directed by Peter Care #"I Heard a Rumour" #:Directed by Andy Morahan #"Love In The First Degree" #:Live performance from 1988 BRIT awards #:Directed by Andy Morahan #"Mr. Sleaze" (Rare Groove Remix) #:Edited by Marek Budzynski #"I Can't Help It" (Club Mix Edit) #:Directed by Andy Morahan #"I Want You Back" #:Directed by Andy Morahan #"Love, Truth & Honesty" #:Directed by Big TV!
