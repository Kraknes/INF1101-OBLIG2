About the company. ==Pronunciation== Fell-knee- ven, pressure on first AND second syllables, where "knee" is pronounced with an audible 'k' and "ven" pronounced as in "raven" without the 'ra'. Fallkniven means "the folding knife" in Swedish. ==Products== Fallkniven basic line-up Fallkniven is best known as a supplier of military and outdoor knives, supplying the Swedish military. The Fallkniven model F1 has been the official survival knife for pilots in the Swedish Air Force since 1995. Models F1 and S1 are approved for U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine air crews. Fallkniven also produces outdoors-, hunting- and kitchen knives such as the "Hunting Knife", the "Fallkniven H1". ===Manufacturing=== Fallkniven is a Swedish company, but most if not all of its production is done by subcontractors.
