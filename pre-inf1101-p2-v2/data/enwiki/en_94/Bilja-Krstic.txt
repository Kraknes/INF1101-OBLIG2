Biljana "Bilja" Krstic (Serbian Cyrillic: Biljana "Bilja" Krstitsh, Serbo-Croatian pronunciation: [biyana bi:ya kr:stitc]; born 9 November 1955) is a Serbian singer. She was born in 1955 in Nis and brought up on the folk traditions of central Serbia. Biljana first studied music in Nis and continued her education in Belgrade to study music at the Belgrade University of Arts. Upon graduating in Belgrade she set out on an extremely successful career in music. To date she has released seven albums and has written scores for such films as Savior, Zona Zamfirova and The Man Who Defended Gavrilo Princip. She lives with her two daughters in Belgrade. ==Biography== Bilja has been on the Yugoslav pop scene for a long time. Her stage experience started at a very young age in Chorus of Youth; later, in the 1970s, she was a member of the cult bands Suncokret and Rani Mraz, led by Bora Dordevic and Dorde Balasevic respectively. After the break-up of Rani Mraz, she went solo. Her first album was released in 1983. She has released three pop-oriented records, and did music for many theatre shows at Belgrade's National Theatre. In the meantime, she graduated from University of Musical Arts, and started to work as a Music Editor on Radio Belgrade. After a successful career in pop music, Bilja Krstic has decided to record material close to her heart ever since her childhood. For more than five years, she patiently collected obscure folk songs from the territories of Kosovo, Serbia, Macedonia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Greece. The results were the albums Bistrik (2001) and Zapisi (2003). Bistrik was re-released by V2-Greece record label, in May 2002. Her third folk Album, Tarpos, was released across Europe in early 2007, under the licence of German record label Intuition/Schott Music, and gained great success amongst World Music critics and audiences (Magazine Songlines, London - Top of the world, and TRADMagazine, France - "Bravos"). Her fourth, the very interesting a capella album The Wellspring, released 2013 (PGP-RTS) and the fifth, Svod, under the licence of England record label ARC Music (2016). The music performed by Bilja Krstic is a fusion: a blend of traditional ethno music, a cappella songs and ethno grooves with elements of improvisation and modern music approach. Their aim is to translate folklore into contemporary art, and for performances to awaken the heart and give rebirth and energy to forgotten emotions. Her sincere stage presence and beautiful voice received great acclaim at more than 600 concerts across the world and in her home country; it was best acknowledged when she was invited as the only female vocal performer from Mediterranean at festival "Mostra Sesc de Artes" in Sao Paulo in 2005. At the time, she was a member of "Mediterraneo Orchestra", formed of about 25 top musicians from all over the world. ==Discography== With Suncokret: Singles: * "Gde ces biti, lepa Kejo" / "Pusto more, pusti vali" (1976) * "Rock 'n' Roll duku duku" / "Gili gili blues" (1976) * "Oj, nevene" / "Tekla voda" (ZKP RTLJ 1976) * "Imam pesmu za sve ljude" / "Covek koga znam" (1978) Albums: * Moje bube (1977) With Rani Mraz: Singles: * "Racunajte na nas" / "Strasan zulj" (1978) * "Oprosti mi Katrin" / "Zivot je more" (1978) * "Panonski mornar" / "Moja draga sad je u Japanu" (1979) * "Lagana stvar" / "Prvi januar (popodne)" (1979) Albums: * Mojoj mami umesto maturske slike u izlogu (1979) * Odlazi cirkus (1980) Solo albums: * Prevari veceras svoje drustvo sa mnom (1983) * Iz unutrasnjeg dzepa (1985) * Loptom do zvezda (1990) * Bilja (1994) With Bistrik Orchestra: * Bistrik (2001) * Zapisi (2003) * Tarpos (2007) * Izvoriste (2013) *Svod (2017) ==Collaborations== She worked with Tenores di Bitti "Mialinu Pira", David D`Or, Marta Sebestyen, Yanka Rupkina, Amira Medunjanin, Tamara Obrovac, Bojan Zulfikarpasic, Vlatko Stefanovski, Nenad Vasilic, Magda Dourado Pucci, Grupa "Synthesis", Vasko Atanasovski, Vlado Kreslin, Bora Dugic, Boban Markovic and Marko Markovic and others. ==External links== *Bilja Krstic's official website Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Female rock singers Category:Musicians from Nis Category:Serbian female singers Category:Serbian rock singers Category:Serbian pop singers Category:University of Arts in Belgrade alumni Category:Yugoslav female singers Category:21st-century women singers
