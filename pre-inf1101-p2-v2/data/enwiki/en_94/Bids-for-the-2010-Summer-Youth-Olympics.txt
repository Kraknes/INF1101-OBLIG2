The bidding for the 2010 Youth Olympics Games began in August 2007, to which nine cities presented their candidature files. In the competition to host the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010, the list was shortened to five in November 2007. The list was further shortened to two in January 2008--Moscow and Singapore.IOC Selects Moscow and Singapore To Youth Olympic Games Short List Moscow was the highest rated city in the evaluation report, but may have been disadvantaged due to the win by Russian city Sochi to host the 2014 Winter Olympics.Olympics: Singapore favourites for Youth Olympics: IOC member Singapore also had a very high evaluation and had a possible geographical advantage, being situated in a region (Southeast Asia) which had never hosted. Singapore was announced as the host city on 21 February 2008 after a tally of a postal vote.Singapore to host the 1st Summer Youth Olympic Games in 2010 ==Process== Cities interested in hosting the games had to have their applications confirmed by their respective National Olympic Committees and submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) by August 31, 2007. On September 3, nine cities were confirmed as official applicants by the Committee. They were later acknowledged as completing the questionnaire due October 26, 2007. A shortlist of five cities was announced on November 19.Five Cities Make Cut For 2010 Youth Olympic Games Although it was planned to have an evaluation committee visit the shortlisted cities in December, eventually each city presented a video conference on December 13. As the IOC predicted, they further eliminated some of the cities before the final stage.List Of 2010 Youth Olympic Games Finalists Could Be Shortened The IOC has stressed that the main goal of these games is not competition, but education based on Olympic values. The host city, therefore, should not have to build new venues for the occasion, but rather use existing infrastructure for the games. Still, the games would include an Olympic village and protocols which would prepare young athletes for future Olympic competition. The risks of quickly preparing for the first edition of the event was a major factor in selection of the final candidates. There will only be two-and-a-half years to organize the Games, but Games with longer lead times may allow some of the non-selected cities to bid for future Games. An evaluation committee viewed a video conference presentation from each city in December 2007. In January, the short list was reduced from five to two, Moscow and Singapore. When the result of the final postal tally was revealed, Singapore won the right to host the Games over Moscow in a tally of 53-44. {| class="wikitable" style="border-collapse: collapse;" |- ! colspan="6" | 2010 Youth Olympic Games bidding results |- | City | NOC Name | bgcolor=""|Postal votes |- ||Singapore|| ||53 |- ||Moscow|| ||44 |} ==Overview of host bid== {| class="wikitable" |+ 2010 Host City !

Singapore | align="center"| ' (SIN) | align="center"| |- | colspan=3 style="padding:0.5em;"| Host of the 117th IOC Session, Singapore made its first formal bid to host a multi-disciplinary sporting event of this magnitude, bigger than its hostings of the Southeast Asian Games in 1973, 1983 and 1993. Banking on its high connectivity with the world, its youthfulness as an independent country and its reputation for excellence and multi-racial harmony, the city-state rolled out a high-publicity campaign. These included being amongst the first to launch its official website, bid logo (despite IOC rules against bid logos) and a bid tagline "Blazing the Trail" on 16 October 2007Channelnewsasia.com and getting the local populace to support its bid, including an effort by students to collect 1 million signatures in support of the games.Singapore Unveils Plan For 2010 Youth Olympic Games Singapore's bid got off to a rocky start when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong expressed concern on 15 July 2007 that the city may not be ready to host the games as the Singapore Sports Hub is expected to be ready only in 2011.Channelnewsasia.com By August, however, the city announced its intentions to proceed with the bid. Parliamentary Secretary for Community Development, Youth and Sports Teo Ser Luck went to study Beijing in September,Youth.SG :: Singapore - Parliamentary Secretary Teo Ser Luck on Olympic Games Fact-Finding Mission and by October, Prime Minister Lee expressed full support. Singapore intends to put up "fully integrated sport, education and cultural programmes" as part of the Games, with emphasis on "compactness" and "vibrancy". All 26 sports will be featured, utilising 24 venues around the city. Suburban facilities such as the Bishan Stadium (for athletics), the Singapore Sports School (Modern Pentathlon), Tampines Bike Park (cycling) and the Toa Payoh Swimming Complex (aquatics and diving) were highlighted as a means of bringing the event to the people. The Youth Olympic Village will be located at the new student residential village of the National University of Singapore, slated for completion months before the event on the former Warren Golf Course. Amongst other educational plans, the bid includes a proposal to build a Sports Museum and Library and the offer of six Singapore Olympic Scholarships annually for young athletes to attend the Singapore Sports School.Singapore 2010 In the IOC evaluation, concerns were still expressed over the building two new venues - the Olympic Village and equestrian complex. However, a construction expert found that the $423 million University of Singapore Olympic Village plan was feasible, and a backup plan should they not be finished was also feasible. The equestrian venue was also expected to be built in time. The $75.5 million budget is considered reasonable and has strong government support. (It is also closer to the initial target of $30-45 million when the Youth Games concept was announced.) The plan was also praised for its compactness. |} ===Evaluation of applicant cities=== ====Applicant cities comparison==== {| class="wikitable" |+ 2010 Applicant Cities ! Category !! Details !!

Although Athens' bid had sentiment and state of the art venues from its recent hosting of the 2004 Summer Olympics, its bid was ultimately eliminated for having a very high budget (US$273 million) and having events too far from the central sites. Bangkok was praised for its accommodations and facilities,Bangkok 2010 Youth Olympic Games Bid Wants Business Support Retrieved 2008-02-22 but like Athens, the venues were too spread out and the nation was also experiencing some political instability. Its budget was also considered inadequate.

Otherwise, Moscow scored high in almost every area except finance, primarily because of a high budget. (Only Athens had a higher proposed budget.) Moscow budgeted US$180 million, including almost half of which (US$76 million) for culture and education programs. The bid was praised for solid government guarantees, an improved contingency fund, and the fact that most venues were ready. Most of the venues and Olympic village are from the 1980 Summer Olympics, which have been maintained over the years. Also cited was Moscow's experience to deliver on time and on target.

However, the overarching (too high) finances still were questioned, and the bid was criticised for seeming to misunderstand and lack comprehension of the cultural and educational goals. Ultimately, Athens was eliminated for its very high budget (US$273 million), which was reduced from its initial estimate, and failure to provide sufficient hotel guarantees. In desiring to use historic venues as they did in the 2004 Summer Games, concerns were raised that events would be too spread out and cause too much travel time.
