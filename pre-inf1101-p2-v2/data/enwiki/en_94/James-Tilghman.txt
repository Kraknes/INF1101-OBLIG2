At the outbreak of the American Revolution, Tilghman at first favored compromise between England and the colonies; while he called for a repeal of the Intolerable Acts, which was so abhorred by colonists, he at the same time denounced the Boston Tea Party. He was regarded, however, as a Loyalist and was placed under arrest by Pennsylvania state authorities until 1778. Tilghman was a trustee of the College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania) from 1775 to 1788, when he resigned. Tilghman's youngest brother was Matthew Tilghman, a delegate to the First and Second Continental Congresses. ===Marriage and family=== Anne Francis Tilghman In 1743 he married Anne Francis (1727-1771), daughter of Tench Francis (Sr.) They had two sons: *Tench Tilghman (1744 - 1786), aide-de-camp to George Washington during the American Revolution. *William Tilghman (1756 - 1827), who became chief justice of Pennsylvania in 1806.
