The other blocks, e.g. used for science and cookery, were added around the playground later. ==Structure== There were approximately 700 pupils on the school roll, of whom around 100 were in the sixth form, at the school's closure in 2014.First Draft The school occupied two sites, with pupils in Year 7 and Year 8 being housed in Y Gadlys (Lower School) and those in Year 9 - Year 13 in Plasdraw (Upper School). Most pupils came from the town of Aberdare, with some travelling from Glynneath, Treorchy and Mountain Ash. ==Bangle Scandal== In 2007, the school attracted media coverage across Britain after it excluded a student, Sarita Watkins-Singh, for wearing a bangle, (or kara) that symbolised her Sikh faith. The student and her family took legal action. In January 2008, Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council informed school governors that it would not provide the school with any further financial assistance, and said that this was in response to the school pursuing the case. The human rights organisation 'Liberty' claimed that the school was in violation of the Race Relations Act 1976, the Equality Act 2006."Bangle girl" case reaches court http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/7458139.stm In July 2008, Watkins- Singh won her case when the high court determined that the school was guilty of indirect discrimination.

The construction of the new PS50m campus began on the Michael Sobell Sports Centre site in 2013 with the intentions of creating a unified education, leisure and community hub. After several delays, the intended September 2014 opening date of the new 1,600 pupil building was pushed back to April 2015 with the formation of Aberdare Community School still set for September 2014. Blaengwawr Comprehensive, Aberdare High and Aberdare Girls' schools were closed at the end of the Summer Term 2014. It was announced that due to delays of the new campus, the four buildings previously occupied by the three schools would temporarily house various school years until a gradual move is possible once the new building is completed 2015. ==Sale for Development== In July 2015, the 1.16 hectare (2.87 acre) school site was sold at auction for PS415,000, four times the guide price. The unknown purchasers were bound by a covenant to ensure that the site could only be used as a school and a playground. ==References== ==External links== *School website Category:Defunct schools in Rhondda Cynon Taf Category:Girls' schools in Wales Category:Aberdare
