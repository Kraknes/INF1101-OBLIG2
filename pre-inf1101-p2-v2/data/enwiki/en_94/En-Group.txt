On 19 December 2018 the US Treasury notified the Congress about its intention to lift sanctions against En+ Group following the corporate restructuring. == Governance == In accordance with the agreement with OFAC the board of directors of En+ Group will consist of twelve directors with a majority of independent directors.

UC RUSAL is a clear low-cost leader in the production of aluminium, and accounted for approximately 6.2% of global aluminium output based on 2017 results. En+ Group's Metals segment operates 10 aluminium smelters and 7 alumina refineries, with its core smelting operations located in Siberia. In addition, UC RUSAL holds a strategic investment in Norilsk Nickel and a 50% interest in the BEMO Project (a joint venture between UC RUSAL and RusHydro comprising Boguchansk HPP and Boguchansk aluminium smelter).

As of 31 December 2016, hydro power plants accounted for 76.6% (15.1 GW) of the Group's installed electricity capacity, which makes the Company the largest privately held hydro power generation company globally. As at 31 December 2016, the Group held an 8% share of the total installed electricity capacity in Russia. The Group's power assets are predominantly located in Siberia, where it has a 37.6% share of total installed electricity capacity in the region. The hydro power operations benefit from the abundant water resources of the Angara and Yenisei river cascades. These plants provide sustainable, low carbon and low- cost power for Russian industrial facilities, including Metals segment's core aluminium smelters. The Group believes that it benefits from lower operating costs compared to other hydro power generation companies in part due to the geographic location, scale and efficient management of the power generating assets. En+ Group's Energy segment is a member of the Global Sustainable Electricity Partnership, a non-profit organisation whose members are the world's leading electricity companies, supplying energy to over 1.2 billion customers. In 2017, En+ Group produced 68.4TWh of electricity and 26.7mn Gcal of heat. ==== Key assets of the En+ Group Energy segment ==== {| class="wikitable" |+style="text-align: left"|Hydropower plants !Country !Name !Location !Start of operations !Installed capacity, MW |- | |Krasnoyarsk HPP |Divnogorsk |1972 -- |6000 |- | |Bratsk HPP |Bratsk |1966 -- |4500 |- | |Ust- Ilimsk HPP |Ust-Ilimsk |1980 -- |3840 |- | |Irkutsk HPP |Irkutsk |1956 -- |662 |} {| class="wikitable" |+style="text-align: left"|Combined heat plants !Country !Name !Location !Start of operations !Installed capacity, MW |- | |CHP-10 |Angarsk |1959 |1100 |- | |CHP-9 |Angarsk |1963 |540 |- | |Novo- Irkutsk CHP |Irkutsk |1975 |708 |- | |Ust-Ilimsk CHP |Ust-Ilimsk |1978 |515 |- | |CHP-11 |Usolye-Sibirskoye |1959 |350 |- | |CHP-6 |Bratsk |1965 |270 |- | |Novo-Ziminskaya CHP |Sayansk |1980 |260 |- | |Avtozavodskaya CHP |Nizhny Novgorod |1931 |580 |} == Renewables == In 2015 En+ Group commenced the operations of the Abakan solar power plant.
