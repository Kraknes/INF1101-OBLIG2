Dithiete is an unsaturated heterocyclic compound that contains two adjacent sulfur atoms and two sp2-hybridized carbon centers. Derivatives are known collectively as dithietes or 1,2-dithietes. With 6 p electrons, 1,2-dithietes are examples of aromatic organosulfur compounds. A few 1,2-dithietes have been isolated. Unsubstituted 1,2-dithiete has been generated in thermolytic reactions and was characterized by microwave spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy in a low temperature matrix. The open ring isomer, dithioglyoxal, HC(S)C(S)H, is less stable than the 1,2-dithiete. The dithione can be prepared (as trans-dithioglyoxal) by low temperature photolysis of 1,3-dithiol-2-one. Quantum chemical calculations reproduce the observed greater stability of 1,2-dithiete only if large basis- sets with polarization functions are used. :Structure of the dithiete S2C2(CO2Me)2.
