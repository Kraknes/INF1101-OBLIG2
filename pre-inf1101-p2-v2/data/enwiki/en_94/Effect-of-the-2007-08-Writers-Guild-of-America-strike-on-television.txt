November 2007 striking writers and supporters rally in Los Angeles The 2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike, which began on November 5, 2007, was a labor conflict that affected a large number of television shows that were due to be broadcast in the United States during the 2007-08 television season. Negotiators for the striking writers reached a tentative agreement on February 8, 2008, and the boards of both guilds unanimously approved the deal on February 10, 2008. Striking writers voted on February 12, 2008, to end the strike immediately, and on February 26, the WGA announced that the contract had been ratified with a 93.6% approval among WGA members. ==Effect on shows== ===Shows with increased number of episodes=== Some shows, especially unscripted or reality shows, benefitted from the strike by providing the networks with new material. {| class="wikitable sortable" |- ! Show ! Network: ! Notes |- | The Amazing Race | CBS | Originally only one season (The Amazing Race 12) was planned for the 2007-2008 season. A second season of the show (The Amazing Race 13) was greenlit shortly after the start of the strike, with the premiere aired on September 28, 2008. The season finale aired on December 7, 2008. |- | Big Brother | CBS | Originally only one season was planned for the show's traditional summer slot in 2008. Due to the writer's strike, a second season for 2008 was ordered. Big Brother 9 aired in the winter-spring period and premiered Tuesday, February 12, 2008 with three episodes per week. Big Brother 10 aired during the summer and premiered Sunday, July 13, 2008 with three episodes per week.. |- | Good News Week | Network Ten (Australia) | Meant to be a one-off special, new episodes made for the first time in 7 years to fill gap left by lack of US product.

Programs aired on Fridays until the start of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. After the shows aired, a second set of four episodes were ordered to air during the May sweeps. The regular daytime version was not affected, but the strike was the subject of the November 30, 2007 taping (airing December 25, 2007), where the Showcase script at the end of a showcase featuring elves on strike against Santa Claus was a parody of the WGA strike. The primetime series also debuted the show's switchover to 1080i high definition, as all ten episodes aired in high-definition; by the end of the season, the show switched entirely to high-definition. |} ===Unaffected shows=== Some shows were not affected by the strike, being unscripted, not using union writers, or completing their production before the strike began. Some shows made in Canada use mainly or solely Canadian writers and were thus unaffected by the US strike. {| class="wikitable sortable" |- ! Show ! Network !

Several television shows, including Journeyman, K-Ville, Big Shots, and Cavemen, were "quietly" cancelled, in part due to the writer's strike, and in part due to low ratings. {| class="wikitable" |- !

Lawrence stated he would either release the finale on DVD or post what would have happened in episodes 13 through 18 on the internet. However, it was announced in May 2008 that ABC picked up Scrubs for an eighth season for 2008-2009. * During the strike, ABC's Dirty Sexy Money was given a full season order. NBC also gave full season orders to Life, and Chuck and also announced that, contrary to recurring rumor, Bionic Woman would also continue production after the strike. TV Guide: "Update: Bionic Woman Has Not Been Unplugged" * FX Network's The Shield is one of the few shows that was able to air the entire season, as it was mostly wrapped before the strike started. Similarly, CBS's returning series, Jericho, aired midseason. Production of the full season was completed prior to the strike and was not affected by the work stoppage. * Some networks such as CBS, due to the financial effects of the strike, ordered a reduced number of pilots. * CBS aired a Canadian series, Flashpoint."CBS bypasses writers to import Canadian cop series", Reuters, January 29, 2008. NBC similarly aired the Canadian series The Listener,"CTV's The Listener picked up by NBC", CTV News, February 4, 2008. but pulled the show after one episode due to low ratings. ===Talk shows=== Late night comedy shows such as The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Late Show with David Letterman, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and Saturday Night Live began airing reruns immediately. Last Call resumed airing on December 3, with host Carson Daly explaining that if he did not do so, his staff would have been fired. On January 2, 2008, the Tonight Show and Late Night returned on NBC with new episodes. Conan O'Brien stated, "An unwritten version of 'Late Night,' though not desirable, is possible -- and no one has to be fired." On November 12, 2007, instead of a recent episode, NBC aired an episode of The Tonight Show from November 17, 2003."The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" Episode dated 17 November 2003 (2003) Beginning the week of November 26, The Tonight Show began continuously airing "vintage" episodes. The Tonight Show was reportedly planning to air new episodes beginning November 19, having guest hosts to fill in for Jay Leno. This did not occur, however. Several talk show hosts who refused to do their shows announced that they would pay non-striking staff members out of their own pockets through the end of the year, including David Letterman and Conan O'Brien. Jay Leno was chided when NBC fired his non- striking staff, after he promised them they would not have to worry about their jobs. Leno later announced that he would also pay his staff for the next 2 weeks starting December 2, 2007. David Letterman and his Worldwide Pants, Inc. production company broke ranks with the networks and negotiated its own independent contract with the WGA in late 2007. The deal was independent and only between the production company and the union, and allowed the company to start new shows in 2008. ===Other=== Although many animated series employ union writers, there is no requirement to do so. For instance, the writers of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, were not union members, and the show remained in production during the strike. The episode "Canada on Strike" was written as a parody of the WGA strike. Movies, such as High School Musical 3: Senior Year, were directly affected by the strike, including those filmed on location. However, the strike did not affect reality shows such as American Idol, whose episodes are unscripted, or news programs, whose writers belong to a different guild. Nevertheless, newswriters at CBS News and at local CBS owned-and-operated television stations (as well as CBS Radio news entities) were subject to the threat of a different strike action by the WGA. CBS News writers under the WGA had been without a contract with the network since April 2005 until a contract was agreed to on January 9, 2008. Similarly, some game shows, such as Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? and The Price Is Right, were not affected because they are unscripted, other than the questions and the prize descriptions (and in Price's case, Showcase skits); by contrast, Sony Pictures' Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune, and Disney's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire had their quiz questions researched and written by WGA writers under deals with their producers. The first season of the game show Duel premiered on December 17, 2007, and ended on December 23, 2007; the first season of the show was the only game show, and thus the only strike- replacement program, that was affected by the strike. The second season premiered on April 4, 2008, and ended on July 25, 2008, with an 8-week break between May 2 and June 27. A revival of American Gladiators was launched sooner than originally scheduled, with taping in November 2007 that aired in January 2008. Other game, contest and reality shows launched sooner than originally scheduled in order to minimize the amount of scripted-program reruns, and CBS commissioned an order of six episodes of The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular, the first in the primetime series with new host Drew Carey (who took over hosting duties that season), which later resulted in four additional episodes later in the season. This resulted in drastic mid-season set changes that allowed the show to switch to high-definition television, initially with these episodes, and the daytime show switched for the start of the next season. While the strike had no effect on sporting events (which are unscripted), the strike also did not affect scripted professional wrestling, as both World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling had in-house ununionized writers. WWE, which had a contract with NBC Universal and aired the biennial Saturday Night's Main Event on the parent network, offered up additional wrestling shows for NBC if needed. Nightline was the only late-night network program to benefit in the Nielsen ratings from the writers strike. As well, many ABC, and some Fox, affiliates won their late news timeslots as a result of the strike, with most ending winning streaks of the local CBS or NBC affiliates. Among these ABC and Fox affiliates were KABC- TV in Los Angeles, WCVB in Boston, WFAA in Dallas, WTTG in Washington, KSTU in Salt Lake City, KMSP in Minneapolis, KTVI in St. Louis, KOMO-TV in Seattle and WXYZ-TV in Detroit. ==See also== * 1988 Writers Guild of America strike * 1960 Writers Guild of America strike * Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on television in the United States * Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers * Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE) * Writers Guild of America, west (WGAW) * ABS-CBN franchise renewal controversy ==References== Category:Labor disputes in the United States Category:2007 in American television Category:2008 in American television Category:Writers Guild of America fi:Kasikirjoittajien lakko 2007-2008#Vaikutukset
