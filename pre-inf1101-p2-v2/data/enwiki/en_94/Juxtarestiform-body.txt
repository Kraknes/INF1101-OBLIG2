The juxtarestiform body is a subdivision of the inferior cerebellar peduncle, which comprises both the juxtarestiform and restiform bodies. ==Function== The juxtarestiform body carries both afferent and efferent fibers connecting the vestibular nuclei and the flocculonodular lobe and fastigial nucleus of the cerebellum. The juxtarestiform body coordinates balance and eye movements by communication between the vestibular apparatus and the cerebellum. ==See also== * Inferior cerebellar peduncle * Flocculonodular lobe * Fastigial nucleus ==Additional images== File:Slide2SEER.JPG|Cerebellum:--Inferior surface showing inferior cerebellar peduncle File:Gray686.png|Upper part of medulla spinalis and hind- and mid-brains; posterior aspect, exposed in situ.
