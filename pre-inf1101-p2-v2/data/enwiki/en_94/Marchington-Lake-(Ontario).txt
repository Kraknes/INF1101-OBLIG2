The Sturgeon River is another main source, and flows into the lake at the spike-shaped arm at the south-eastern end. The North River flows into the middle of the lake on the north-west side. Other inflows are (clockwise from north-east) Watin Creek, Kinniwap Creek, Mall Creek, Martin Creek and Kee Creek.
