Swiecie () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Lesna, within Luban County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland, near the border with the Czech Republic. ==Geography== It lies on the southeastern rim of the historic Upper Lusatia region, approximately south of Lesna and south of Luban. The village is located west of the regional capital Wroclaw. From 1975 to 1998, Swiecie was part of Jelenia Gora Voivodeship. ==History== Swiecie Castle, situated on a Gneiss rock, was first mentioned in a 1329 treaty between King John of Bohemia, who had been enfeoffed with the Upper Lusatian estates by Emperor Louis IV, and Duke Henry I of Jawor, ruler over the adjacent Lower Silesian lands in the east. The fortress, together with the neighbouring castles at Lesna and Czocha were finally incorporated into the Lands of the Bohemian Crown in 1346. According to the 1635 Peace of Prague, Swiecie passed to the Electorate of Saxony. In 1719 the estates were purchased by the Saxon field marshal Jacob Heinrich von Flemming. Upon the Vienna Congress in 1815, the area was incorporated into the Prussian Province of Silesia. ==References== ==External links== *Swiecie Castle Category:Villages in Luban County
