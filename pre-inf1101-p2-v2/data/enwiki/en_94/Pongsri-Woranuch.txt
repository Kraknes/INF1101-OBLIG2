Pongsri Woranuch (Thai: ph`ngsrii wrnuch; ) is a Thai musician. She first became a star in the 1950s with the orchestra of Suraphon Sombatjalern, practicing music in the style of luk thung. Soon she became the first singer to be called "queen of luk thung". Woranut melded the style of traditional Thai folk music to music from outside the region, including various genres of East Asian music, Latin American music, and American country music and film music. Alongside Suraphon Sombatjalern, she is considered one of the most important of this genre's practitioners.John Clewley, Thailand. The Rough Guide to World Music, 2nd ed., 2000, v.2, p. 245. In 1992, she became the second luk thung artist awarded the title of Thai National Artist. ==References== Pongsri Woranuch Category:National Artists of Thailand Category:Living people Category:1938 births Category:People from Chai Nat Province
