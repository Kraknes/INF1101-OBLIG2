Location of the state of Florida in the United States of America The following are official state symbols of the U.S. state of Florida, as defined by state statutes. The majority of the symbols were chosen after 1950; only the two oldest symbols--the state flower (chosen in 1909), and the state bird (chosen in 1927), and the state nickname (chosen in 1970)--are not listed in the 2010 Florida Statutes. Under the Florida Statutes, all state symbols fall under the purview of the Executive Branch (Title IV), Secretary of State (Chapter 15), as part of the Secretary of State's role as "Chief Cultural Officer." ==Insignia== {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;" ! width=8% | Type ! width=25% | Symbol ! width=40% | Description ! width=8% | Year ! width=8% | Image ! width=10% | Statute |- |Flag | Flag |A red saltire (diagonal cross) on a white background, with the seal of Florida superimposed on the center.
