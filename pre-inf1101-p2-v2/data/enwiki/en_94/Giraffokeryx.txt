Giraffokeryx is an extinct genus of medium-sized giraffids known from the Miocene of the Indian subcontinent and Eurasia. It is distinguished from other giraffids by the four ossicones on its head; one pair in front of the eyes on the anterior aspect of the frontal bone and the other behind the eyes in the frontoparietal region overhanging the temporal fossae. It has a brachydont dentition like in other giraffids and its legs and feet are of medium length. Bhatti, Z.H., Khan, M.A., Khan, A.M., Akhtar, M., Ghaffar, A., Iqbal, M., Ikram, T.

The distribution of this latter species and G. punjabiensis indicates that the Himalayas still did not act as a barrier for faunal dispersal during the middle Miocene. * G. anatoliensis, a partial skull with a postorbital horn and isolated teeth from Turkey, had shorter and less inclined horns than G. punjabiensis.Geraads, D., Aslan, F.

It is a possible ancestor of both. ==See also== * Hydaspitherium ==References== ==Further reading== Category:Prehistoric giraffes Category:Prehistoric even-toed ungulate genera Category:Miocene even-toed ungulates Category:Miocene mammals of Europe Category:Miocene mammals of Asia Category:Fossil taxa described in 1910
