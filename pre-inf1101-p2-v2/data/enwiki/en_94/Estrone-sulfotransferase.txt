Estrone sulfotransferase (EST) (), also known as estrogen sulfotransferase, is an enzyme that catalyzes the transformation of an unconjugated estrogen like estrone into a sulfated estrogen like estrone sulfate. It is a steroid sulfotransferase and belongs to the family of transferases, to be specific, the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. This enzyme participates in androgen and estrogen metabolism and sulfur metabolism. Steroid sulfatase is an enzyme that catalyzes the reverse reaction, the transfer of a sulfate to an unconjugated estrogen. ==Reaction== In enzymology, an EST is an enzyme that catalyzes the following chemical reaction: :3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + estrone \rightleftharpoons adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + estrone 3-sulfate Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and estrone, whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and estrone 3-sulfate. The enzyme also catalyzes the same reaction for estradiol, with estradiol sulfate as the product. ==Types== Two enzymes have been identified that together are thought to represent estrone sulfotransferase (EST): * SULT1A1 (catalyzes the reactions estradiol to estradiol sulfate and, to a lesser extent than SULT1E1, estrone to estrone sulfate) * SULT1E1 (catalyzes the reactions estrone to estrone sulfate and estradiol to estradiol sulfate) ==Function== Distribution of and EST activities for interconversion of estradiol and estrone in adult human tissues. ==Structure== As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and . ==Names== The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:estrone 3-sulfotransferase. Other names in common use include 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate-estrone 3-sulfotransferase, estrogen sulfotransferase, estrogen sulphotransferase, oestrogen sulphotransferase, and 3'-phosphoadenylylsulfate:oestrone sulfotransferase. ==See also== * Steroidogenic enzyme ==References== == Further reading == * * * Category:EC 2.8.2 Category:Enzymes of known structure
