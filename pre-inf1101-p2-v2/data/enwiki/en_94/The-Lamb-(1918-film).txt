The Lamb is a 1918 American short comedy film starring Harold Lloyd. It is believed to be lost. Like many American films of the time, The Lamb was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards. The Chicago Board of Censors required cuts of the first, fourth, and sixth tough dancing scenes and of the men wiggling their backs in comedy duel scenes. ==Cast== * Harold Lloyd as The Boy * Snub Pollard * Bebe Daniels * William Blaisdell * Sammy Brooks * Billy Fay * Oscar Larson * Gus Leonard * Edith Sinclair * William Strohbach (as William Strawback) * Dorothea Wolbert ==See also== * Harold Lloyd filmography * List of lost films ==References== ==External links== * Category:1918 films Category:1918 short films Category:American films Category:1918 comedy films Category:American silent short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Gilbert Pratt Category:Films directed by Harold Lloyd Category:Lost American films Category:American comedy films Category:Comedy short films Category:1918 lost films Category:Lost comedy films
