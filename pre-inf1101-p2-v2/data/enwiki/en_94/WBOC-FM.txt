WBOC-FM (102.5 FM) is a radio station that broadcasts an adult contemporary format. Licensed to Princess Anne, Maryland, United States, the station is owned by the Draper Holdings Business Trust, as part of a cluster with CBS/Fox affiliate WBOC-TV (channel 16), NBC affiliate WRDE-LD (channel 31), Telemundo affiliate WBOC-LD (channel 42), and sister radio stations WCEM-FM, WTDK, WCEM and WAAI. ==History== Logo as "Joy 102.5," used until August 18, 2015 The station went on the air December 24, 1976 as WOLC, a religious station owned by Maranatha, Inc. (not to be confused with the unrelated Maranatha Broadcasting Company, the owners of WFMZ-TV in Allentown, Pennsylvania). In August 2015, Maranatha agreed to sell WOLC to Draper Holdings Business Trust, owner of WBOC-TV, and took the station off the air on August 18. Draper moved WOLC's studios from Princess Anne to the Salisbury studios of WBOC-TV, using the space formerly occupied by the former WBOC radio (now WTGM and WQHQ); it also announced that the station would introduce a format that, while not yet chosen, would include news, weather, and sports content from WBOC-TV. Draper also filed to change the station's call letters to WBOC-FM. The sale was completed on November 10, 2015 at a purchase price of $650,000; the change to WBOC-FM took effect at that time. The station returned to the air on November 20, and aired Christmas music without commercials through the holiday season. WBOC-FM launched its eventual adult contemporary format on December 31, 2015. ==References== ==External links== *102-5 WBOC Online * BOC-FM Category:Radio stations established in 1976 Category:1976 establishments in Maryland Category:Adult contemporary radio stations in the United States
