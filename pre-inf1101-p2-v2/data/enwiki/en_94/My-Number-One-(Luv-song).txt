My Number One is the twelfth single by Dutch girl group Luv', released in the autumn of 1980 by CNR/Carrere Records. The song appears on the album Forever Yours, and was a chart success in Benelux and a minor hit in Germany. "My Number One" served as the official introduction to the public and the media of Luv's new member, Ria Thielsch (who replaced Patty Brard). ==Song information== Patty Brard suddenly left Luv' in August 1980 as the group was promoting the single One More Little Kissie. This departure had a negative impact as the group had legal obligations and had already recorded new material for an album. A new member was quickly added: Ria Thielsch (who like Patty had Indonesian and New Guinean origins). Though she made some appearances by performing One More Little Kissie on stage and on TV, Ria was officially introduced with the release of a new single: "My Number One". The track is a pop tune with military march-style elements and is considered Luv's best composition according to Hans van Hemert,Hans van Hemert's interview the trio's producer. ==Chart performance== The song was a Top 5 hit in the Netherlands and in Flanders (Belgium). It was Luv's last chart entry outside the Dutch speaking zone, ending the group's succession of export hits. It was a modest Top 60 single in Germany. {| class="wikitable" !align="left"|Charts (1980) !align="left"|Peak position |- |align="left"|Europarade (currently Eurochart Hot 100 Singles) |align="center"|15 |- |align="left"|Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) |align="center"|5 |- |align="left"|Netherlands (Nationale Hitparade (currently Single Top 100) |align="center"|4 |- |align="left"|Belgium/Flanders (BRT Top 30/Radio 2 Top 30) |align="center"|5 |- |align="left"|Germany (Musikmarkt/Media Control) |align="center"|60 |} ==References== Category:1980 singles Category:Luv' songs Category:Songs written by Hans van Hemert Category:Songs written by Piet Souer Category:Carrere Records singles Category:1980 songs
