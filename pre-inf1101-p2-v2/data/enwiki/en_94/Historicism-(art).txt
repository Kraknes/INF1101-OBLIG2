Thomas Cole, The Architect's Dream, 1840 Schwerin Palace, historical ducal seat of Mecklenburg, Germany - an example of historicism in architecture Historicism or historism () comprises artistic styles that draw their inspiration from recreating historic styles or imitating the work of historic artisans.Lucie-Smith, Edward. The Thames and Hudson Dictionary of Art Terms. London: Thames & Hudson, 1988, p. 100. This is especially prevalent in architecture, such as Revival architecture. Through a combination of different styles or implementation of new elements, historicism can create completely different aesthetics than former styles. Thus, it offers a great variety of possible designs. In the history of art, after Neoclassicism which in the Romantic era could itself be considered a historicist movement, the 19th century included a new historicist phase characterized by an interpretation not only of Greek and Roman classicism, but also of succeeding stylistic eras, which were increasingly considered equivalent. In particular in architecture and in the genre of history painting, in which historical subjects were treated with great attention to accurate period detail, the global influence of historicism was especially strong from the 1850s onwards. The change is often related to the rise of the bourgeoisie during and after the Industrial Revolution. By the end of the century, in the fin de siecle, Symbolism and Art Nouveau followed by Expressionism and Modernism acted to make Historicism look outdated, although many large public commissions continued in the 20th century. The Arts and Crafts style managed to combine a looser vernacular historicism with elements of Art Nouveau and other contemporary styles. Influences of historicism remained strong until the 1950s in many countries. When postmodern architecture became widely popular during the 1980s, a Neo- Historism style followed, that is still prominent and can be found around the world, especially in representative and upper-class buildings. ==List of Historicism and Revivalism in Western architecture and decorative arts== International * Baroque Revival * Beaux-Arts * Byzantine Revival * Egyptian Revival * Gothic Revival * Greek Revival / Neo-Grec * Moorish Revival * Neoclassical * New Classical / Neo-Historism * Renaissance Revival (Chateauesque*Italianate*Palazzo style) * Romanesque Revival * Second Empire * Swiss chalet style * Vernacular British Empire * Adam style * Bristol Byzantine * Carpenter Gothic (Canada) * Edwardian Baroque * Indo-Saracenic Revival (India) * Jacobethan * Queen Anne style * Regency * Scottish baronial style (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) * Tudor Revival / Black-and-White Revival France * Directoire style * Empire style * Napoleon III style Germany * Biedermeier * Grunderzeit * Nazi architecture * Resort style * Rundbogenstil Greece and Balkans * Mycenaean Revival * Serbo-Byzantine Revival Italy * Stile Umbertino Mexico * Spanish Colonial Revival architecture * Mayan Revival Netherlands * Traditionalist School Portugal * Pombaline * Neo-Manueline * Soft Portuguese style Romania * Romanian Revival Russian Empire and USSR * Byzantine Revival * Russian Revival * Stalinist architecture Scandinavia * Dragestil * National Romantic style Spain * Neo-Mudejar United States * Jeffersonian architecture * American Renaissance * Carpenter Gothic * Collegiate Gothic * Colonial Revival * Federal style * Greco Deco * Mediterranean Revival * Mission Revival * Polish Cathedral style * Pueblo Revival * Queen Anne style * Richardsonian Romanesque * Spanish Colonial Revival * Territorial Revival ==See also== *Grunderzeit *Revivalism (architecture) *Resort architecture () - a specific style of historicism, that is popular on the German Baltic Sea coast *Academicism *Musical historicism ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Art movements Category:19th century in art Category:19th century in the arts
