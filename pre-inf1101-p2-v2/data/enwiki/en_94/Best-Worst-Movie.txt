According to Stephenson, the turning point came in April 2006; he stated, "I woke up one morning with a really warm feeling and I was smiling ear to ear. I was next to my wife and I said, 'I am the child star of the worst movie ever made... there's a story here.'" Not all participants in Troll 2 were eager to revisit the film. Stephenson noted that he had trouble convincing actors Don Packard and Connie Young to be included in the project, although he was eventually able to convince both to appear in it. ==Release== The film premiered at the South by Southwest festival in March 2009, and was released on DVD in November 2010. ==Reception== Best Worst Movie received very positive reviews.
