Estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR-gamma), also known as NR3B3 (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group B, member 3), is a nuclear receptor that in humans is encoded by the ESRRG (EStrogen Related Receptor Gamma) gene. It behaves as a constitutive activator of transcription. This protein is a member of nuclear hormone receptor family of steroid hormone receptors. No physiological activating ligand is known for this orphan receptor, but 4-hydroxytamoxifen and diethylstilbestrol act as inverse agonists and deactivate ESRRG. It also seems to be the target of bisphenol A (see below). == Bisphenol A binding == There is evidence that bisphenol A functions as an endocrine disruptor by binding strongly to ERR-g. BPA as well as its nitrated and chlorinated metabolites seems to binds strongly to ERR-g (dissociation constant = 5.5 nM), but not to the estrogen receptor (ER)., BPA binding to ERR-g preserves its basal constitutive activity. It can also protect it from deactivation from the selective estrogen receptor modulator 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Different expression of ERR-g in different parts of the body may account for variations in bisphenol A effects. For instance, ERR-g has been found in high concentration in the placenta, explaining reports of high bisphenol A accumulation there. == References == == External links == * == Further reading == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Intracellular receptors Category:Transcription factors Category:Human female endocrine system
