Woody Guthrie in 1943 American singer-songwriter Woody Guthrie's published recordings are culled from a series of recording sessions in the 1940s and 1950s. At the time they were recorded they were not set down for a particular album, so are found over several albums not necessarily in chronological order. The more detailed section on recording sessions lists the song by recording date. ==Selected published discography== {|class="wikitable plainrowheaders" ! scope="col"| Year ! scope="col" style="width:300px;"|Album details ! scope="col" style="width:300px;"|Comments |- ! scope="row" style="text-align:center;"| 1940 | Dust Bowl Ballads *Label: Victor Records | *Reissued in 1964 and 2000 by Folkways Records and Buddha Records respectively.https://folkways.si.edu/woody-guthrie/dust-bowl-ballads/american- folk-struggle-protest/music/album/smithsonian |- ! scope="row" style="text- align:center;"| 1951 | Nursery Days *Label: Folkways Records FC 7675 | *Reissued in 1992 by Smithsonian Folkways https://folkways.si.edu/woody- guthrie/nursery-days/american-folk-childrens/music/album/smithsonian |- ! scope="row" style="text-align:center;"rowspan="2"| 1956 | Songs to Grow on for Mother and Child *Label: Folkways Records FC 7015 | *Reissued in 1991 by Smithsonian Folkways SFW45035 https://folkways.si.edu/woody-guthrie/songs-to- grow-on-for-mother-and-child/american-folk-childrens/music/album/smithsonian |- | Bound for Glory *Label: Folkways Records FA 2481 | *Reissued in 2006 by Smithsonian Folkways FW02481 |- ! scope="row" style="text-align:center;"| 1960 | Ballads of Sacco & Vanzetti *Label: Folkways Records FH 5485 | *Reissued in 1996 by Smithsonian Folkways SFW40060 https://folkways.si.edu/woody- guthrie/ballads-of-sacco-and-vanzetti/american-folk-struggle- protest/music/album/smithsonian |- ! scope="row" style="text-align:center;"| 1962 | Woody Guthrie Sings Folk Songs *Label: Folkways Records FA 2483 | *Reissued in 1989 by Smithsonian Folkways SFW40007 https://folkways.si.edu/woody-guthrie-sings-folk-songs/american-folk-struggle- protest/music/album/smithsonian |- ! scope="row" style="text-align:center;" rowspan="2"| 1964 | Hard Travelin' *Label: Disc Records D-110 | |- | Library of Congress Recordings *Label: Elektra Records EKL-271/272 | * Reissued in 1988 by Rounder Records |- ! scope="row" style="text-align:center;"| 1972 | Greatest Songs of Woody Guthrie *Label: Vanguard Records VSD 35/36 | |- ! scope="row" style="text-align:center;"| 1976 | Struggle *Label: Folkways Records FA 2485 | * Reissued in 1990 by Smithsonian Folkways SFW40025 https://folkways.si.edu/woody-guthrie/struggle |- ! scope="row" style="text- align:center;"| 1987 | Columbia River Collection *Label: Rounder Records 1036 | |- ! scope="row" style="text-align:center;"| 1994 | Long Ways to Travel: The Unreleased Folkways Masters, 1944-1949 *Label: Smithsonian Folkways SF CD 40046 | |- ! scope="row" style="text-align:center;"rowspan="2"| 1997 | This Land Is Your Land, The Asch Recordings, Vol.1 *Label: Smithsonian Folkways SFW40100 | |- | Muleskinner Blues, The Asch Recordings, Vol.2 *Label: Smithsonian Folkways SFW40101 | |- ! scope="row" style="text- align:center;"| 1998 | Hard Travelin', The Asch Recordings, Vol.3 *Label: Smithsonian Folkways SFW40102 | |- ! scope="row" style="text-align:center;"| 1999 | Buffalo Skinners, The Asch Recordings, Vol.4 *Label: Smithsonian Folkways SFW40103 | |- ! scope="row" style="text-align:center;"| 2007 | The Live Wire: Woody Guthrie in Performance 1949 *Label: Woody Guthrie Foundation | * Reissued in 1990 by Rounder Records in 2011 |- ! scope="row" style="text- align:center;"| 2009 | My Dusty Road http://www.woodyguthrie.org/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store;_Code=twgs_Code=MDR&Category;_Code= *Label: Rounder Records | |- ! scope="row" style="text-align:center;"| 2012 |Woody At 100: The Woody Guthrie Centennial Collection *Label: Smithsonian Folkways SFW40200 | |- |} ==Recording sessions== The list here is organized by recording session and is mostly sourced from the discography put together by Dr. Guy Lodgson in 1990-1991 at the Smithsonian Institution as it appears in the book "Hard Travelin' The Life and Legacy of Woody Guthrie". *Note: A blank cell below a date indicate that the date is repeated on that row. ===1940, Library Of Congress, Washington, D.C., sessions with Alan Lomax=== {| border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" rules="all" class="hintergrundfarbe1 rahmenfarbe1" style="margin:1em 1em 1em 0;
