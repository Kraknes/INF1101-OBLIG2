Leslie Owen Fox was awarded the George Cross for '...performing his duty in a most gallant and determined manner' when rescuing an injured man from a bombsite in Fulham on the 20 February 1944.Civil Defence Association - George Cross recipients ==20 February 1944== Leslie Owen Fox, a carpenter by trade, was a Deputy Leader in the West Kensington Heavy Rescue Squad. The Heavy Rescue Squad was a Civil Defence Service brigade detailed to make bombed out buildings as safe as possible so rescue of any trapped people could be attempted. The squad is usually composed of a bricklayer, a plumber, an electrician and a group of general labourers, all of whom completed a first aid course. On the 20 February 1945, Fox was called to the neighbouring borough of Fulham where a number of houses had been destroyed and incendiaries had set fire to the wreckage. Beneath the rubble cries of a trapped man could be heard and Fox started to tunnel towards him. Fox had to dig while being sprayed with water to prevent him being burned by the fires around him. After two hours of digging he managed to burrow and located two people. Fox returned to his comrades to discuss how to extricate the man but his tunnel then collapsed. Undeterred, he started digging again and soon shored up the tunnel which allowed a trained first aider to enter and see to the injured man, who was subsequently safely removed. ==George Cross citation== Notice of his award was published in the London Gazette on the 20 February 1945.London Gazette 20 February 1945 ==Sale of medal== Fox's George Cross was sold in June, 2008 and reached a hammer price of PS20,000.George Cross medal makes PS20,000 ==References== * Hissey, Terry - Come if ye Dare - The Civil Defence George Crosses, (2008), Civil Defence Assn () Category:British recipients of the George Cross Category:1904 births Category:1944 deaths Category:People from Fulham
