The Amir Timur Museum is located in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan. It opened in 1996, and is dedicated to the Mongol warlord Amir Timur (Tamerlane). ==Origin== After Uzbekistan became independent in 1991, much attention was given to the revival of the nation's spiritual and cultural heritage, including recognition of historical persons who had an important role in world civilization. Among those was Amir Temur, the warlord, politician and reformer, patron of science, education, trade, culture, and craft. Having established a great centralized state, he strengthened its power and also united many nations and people. Amir Temur's rule promoted science, education, culture, architecture, fine arts, music and poetry, laying the foundations of the Timurid Renaissance. Former President Islam Karimov encouraged celebration of Timur, linking the Mongol ruler's achievements with the President's own style of governance. Karimov declared 1996 to be the "Year of Amir Temur", and the 660th anniversary was widely celebrated in Uzbekistan, and the republic subsequently resolved to build a state museum in central Tashkent, featuring the Timurid history.Resolution 99 of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan, March 14, 1996 Museum interior ==Opening== The ceremonial opening of the round museum structure was held on 18 October 1996 in the presence of Uzbek people and foreign guests.
