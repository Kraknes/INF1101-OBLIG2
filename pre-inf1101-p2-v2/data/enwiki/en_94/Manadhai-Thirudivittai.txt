Rediff wrote: "On paper, Manathai Thirudi Vittai seems to have everything going for it. Yet, somehow, it doesn't quite jell. For the most part, the film oscillates between the good and the merely banal". Hindu wrote:"Armed with a suspenseful story and a cohesive screenplay, director has come out with a fare that is reasonably appealing". Thiraipadam.com wrote, "This is a Prabhu Deva movie. What were you expecting, "Hey Ram"? It's enjoyable, entertaining fluff. The comedy, though not always successful, is sometimes very funny. The songs are great. Yuvan Shankar Raja has written some great music, and Prabhu Deva shows off his dancing skills (especially in a brief dance in "Color Color"), thankfully returning a little to his roots." == Legacy == Over the years the film's comedy has been appreciated by many people. Vadivelu's character of Steve Waugh inspired countless memes. The dialogue "Give respect, take respect" is parodied by Ashwanth Ashokkumar in Thambi (2019). ==References== ==External links== * Manadhai Thirudivittai at CineSouth Category:2001 films Category:Films shot in Ooty Category:2000s Tamil-language films Category:Indian films Category:Indian romantic comedy films Category:Films scored by Yuvan Shankar Raja Category:2001 romantic comedy films
