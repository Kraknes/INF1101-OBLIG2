{| |} HMS E31 was a British E class submarine built by Scotts, Greenock. She was laid down in December 1914, commissioned on 8 January 1916, and sold for scrap on 6 September 1922. ==Design== Like all post-E8 British E-class submarines, E31 had a displacement of at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of and a beam length of . She was powered by two Vickers eight-cylinder two-stroke diesel engines and two electric motors.Akerman, P. (1989). Encyclopaedia of British submarines 1901-1955\. 149-150\. Maritime Books. The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of . British E-class submarines had fuel capacities of of diesel and ranges of when travelling at . E31 was capable of operating submerged for five hours when travelling at . E31 was armed with a 12-pounder QF gun mounted forward of the conning tower. She had five 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, two in the bow, one either side amidships, and one in the stern; a total of 10 torpedoes were carried. E-Class submarines had wireless systems with power ratings; in some submarines, these were later upgraded to systems by removing a midship torpedo tube. Their maximum design depth was although in service some reached depths of below . Some submarines contained Fessenden oscillator systems. ==Crew== Her complement was three officers and 28 men. ==Service history== HMS E31 was involved in a curious incident when she was operating with the sea plane carrier in the North Sea in an air raid on the Zeppelin sheds at Tondern on 4 May 1916. While on a mission, LZ 32 was spotted by light cruisers and who opened fire on the airship. Just as they were doing this HMS E31 was operating with the sea plane carrier in the North Sea in an air raid on the Zeppelin sheds at Tondern on 4 May 1916. E31 surfaced and spotted the airship, but being vulnerable on the surface, the sub dived to avoid attack. When the submarine put its periscope up, it observed that the Zeppelin was losing altitude after being hit by shells from and . E31 then surfaced just in time to get in the fatal shot and brought the Zeppelin down. HMS E31 then proceeded to rescue seven survivors from the crew of LZ 32. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * Category:British E-class submarines of the Royal Navy Category:Ships built on the River Clyde Category:1915 ships Category:World War I submarines of the United Kingdom Category:Royal Navy ship names
