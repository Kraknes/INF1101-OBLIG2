The Interactive Software Federation of Europe (ISFE) is an independent federation, representing the interests of the video game industry in Europe to the main stakeholders: EU institutions, international organisations, academics, or the general public. This objective is pursued through a variety of actions, such as meetings, conferences, sponsorships and informational actions aimed towards the public. ==History== Founded in 1998, the ISFE initially only included the national interactive software trade associations of the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands. In January 2002, the ISFE opened up to include any company representing the industry within the 27 member states of the European Union, plus Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. In 2002 the ISFE was registered under Belgian law as an international association with scientific and pedagogical purposes. In April 2003, ISFE founded PEGI ('Pan European Game Information) which has become the gaming industry's rating system for Europe. The ISFE secretariat is located in Brussels. ==Activities== ISFE's main activities regard the following goals: * Creating European awareness * Providing information to consumers * Providing research/market data * Supporting national representation in all EU countries * Acting against software piracy ==Members== ===Game publishers=== * Activision Blizzard * Bandai Namco Entertainment * Disney Interactive Studios * Electronic Arts * Gameloft * King * Microsoft * Nintendo * SEGA * Sony Computer Entertainment Europe * Square Enix * Supercell * Take-Two Interactive Software * Ubisoft * Warner Bros.
