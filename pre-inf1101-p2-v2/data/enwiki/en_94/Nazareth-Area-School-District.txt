The project included a new $7 million swimming pool. The new building is located on Freidenstahl Avenue in Upper Nazareth Township, adjacent to the high school campus. The school was completed in 2009 in time for the 2009-2010 school year. It cost an estimated total of $57 million. With the opening of the new middle school in 2009, the Nazareth area underwent a district-wide grade reconfiguration. Grades Kindergarten through 3rd grade remained in the elementary schools.

Grades 7 and 8 now attend the new middle school building. Only the high school, built in 1956, remains unaffected by the grade changes. ==Background Statistics== According to a 2006 survey distributed to every household in the Nazareth Area School District, with a 19% participation rate: ===Residency Within the District=== *30.9% of respondents lived in Bushkill Township *23.3% lived in Lower Nazareth Township *19.7% lived in Upper Nazareth Township *18.8% lived in the borough of Nazareth, PA *2.5% lived in the borough of Stockertown. *4.4% lived in the borough of Tatamy. ===Attendance Distribution=== 40.8% of responding households had NASD students, of those: *18% had children attending Bushkill Elementary School *17% had children attending Lower Nazareth Elementary School. *18% had children attending Floyd R.
