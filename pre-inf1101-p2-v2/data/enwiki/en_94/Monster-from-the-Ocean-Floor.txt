Monster from the Ocean Floor is a 1954 science fiction film about a sea monster that terrorizes a Mexican cove. The film was directed by Wyott Ordung and starred Anne Kimbell and Stuart Wade. It was the first film produced by Roger Corman (although he had previously written Highway Dragnet). ==Plot== Julie Blair (Kimbell) is an American vacationing at a seaside village in Mexico. She hears stories about a man-eating creature dwelling in the cove. She meets Dr. Baldwin (Dick Pinner), a marine biologist, and they fall for one another. The mysterious death of a diver inspires Julie to investigate, but Baldwin is very skeptical. She sees a giant amoeba rising from the ocean. ==Cast== *Anne Kimbell as Julie Blair *Stuart Wade as Steve Dunning *Dick Pinner as Dr. Baldwin *Wyott Ordung as Pablo *Inez Palange as Tula *Jonathan Haze as Joe *David Garcia as Jose *Roger Corman as Tommy ==Production== It was the first film produced by Roger Corman.

Corman said when he made the film, "I was surprisingly confident. I think if I were to do it now, I would be very worried that I couldn't do it. But at the age of twenty-five or whatever, I had ambition and confidence. You do things that, when you're older and smarter, you wouldn't do.

"I thought, for the money he brought it in for, was absolutely remarkable," said Gordon. I thought it was very, very good and that he was a very nice, young, polite guy. And very nice-looking, properly dressed -- he looked Uke a young executive, not some guy who was just loUing around like some of the other guys who were around in those days, coming around to try and get jobs."
