According to the Sumerian King List, Kuara was also the home of Dumuzid, the fisherman, the legendary third king of Uruk .Beaulieu, Paul-Alain (2003) The Pantheon of Uruk During the Neo-Babylonian Period. Brill. , p. 114 The city's patron deity was Meslamtaea (Nergal).Sumerian City-States In Sumerian mythology, Kuara was also considered the birthplace of the god Marduk (Asarluhi), Enki's son. The cults of Marduk and Ninehama were centered in Kuara.A.R. George (1992) Babylonian Topographical Texts, Peeters. Black, Jeremy A (2004) The Literature of Ancient Sumer . Oxford University Press. , p. 134, 365 ==History of archaeological research== The location was excavated for a few days in 1855 by J. E. Taylor. He found a few inscribed bricks, and a single cuneiform tablet.J. E. Taylor, "Notes on Abu Shahrein and Tel el Lahm", Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 15 (1855), pp. 404-415E. Sollberger, "Mr. Taylor in Chaldaea", Anatolian Studies, 22 (1972), pp. 129-139 While working at Eridu for the British Museum in 1918, R. Campbell Thompson excavated there briefly.R.

It was a seaport to the Persian Gulf, and traded with the port of Dilmun.Howard-Carter, Theresa, "Dilmun: At Sea or Not at Sea?: A Review Article", Journal of Cuneiform Studies, 39 (1987), pp. 54-117 In 709 BC, the Assyrian king Sargon II was trying to capture Marduk-apal-iddina II, who fled to Kuara, whereupon Sargon's army laid siege and destroyed the city.Boederman, John (2002) The Cambridge Ancient History. Cambridge University Press. , p. 99Potts, Daniel T. (1997) Mesopotamian Civilization: The Material Foundations. Cornell University Press. , p. 191 Alluvial soil carried by the Euphrates continually extended the land farther into the Persian Gulf; thus the modern site is far from the sea, even though it was a sea port 4500 years ago. ==See also== *Cities of the Ancient Near East ==References== ==Further reading== *H.
