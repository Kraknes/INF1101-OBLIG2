Varicosavirus is a genus of plant viruses that currently consists of one recognised species: Lettuce big-vein associated varicosavirus. The virus is associated with swelling in plant vein tissues. They are negative single stranded RNA viruses. Infection occurs through soil by the spores of the fungus Olpidium brassicae. ==Structure== Virions consist of a non-enveloped rod-shaped capsid, having a helical symmetry of 120-360 nm in length, and a width of 18-30 nm. ==Genome== The genome consists of a bi-segmented linear, single-stranded negative sense RNA. The first segment is about 6350-7000 nucleotides in length; the second, about 5630-6500 nucleotides in length. ==References== ==External links== * Viralzone: Varicosavirus Category:Varicosaviruses Category:Virus genera
