There are cliffs which often reach over high. Hummock Island is situated between Rabbit Island and Middle Island. Other islands in the Hummock Island group include Green Island and Gid's Island. In the middle of the Twentieth Century the island was used as an extension of the New Island sheep farm, and heavy grazing caused much of the Tussac grass to be eaten out. This has left areas of bare 'black ground'. However, the present owner has indicated that he will not restock the island but will allow the vegetation to recover. Gid's and Middle Islands are nature reserves. ==Important Bird Area== The Hummock Island group has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA).
