The Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) is an agency of the United States Department of the Navy that manages health care activities for the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. BUMED operates hospitals and other health care facilities as well as laboratories for biomedical research, and trains and manages the Navy's many staff corps related to medicine. Its headquarters is located at the Defense Health Headquarters in Fairfax County, Virginia. BUMED has 63,000 medical personnel and more than a million eligible beneficiaries. == History == BUMED was one of the original five Navy bureaus formed in 1842 to replace the Board of Navy Commissioners. It is one of two bureaus still in existence. BUMED was headquartered at the Old Naval Observatory from 1942 until 2012. In 2005, Navy Medicine aligned its shore facilities into four overarching commands: Navy Medicine East, Navy Medicine West, Navy Medicine National Capital Area, and Navy Medicine Support Command. In 2012, Navy Medicine Support Command was renamed and realigned into the Navy Medicine Education and Training Command, with its non-training units becoming independent under BUMED. Navy Medicine National Capital Area's largest component, the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, was merged in 2011 with Walter Reed Army Medical Center to form the joint Walter Reed National Military Medical Center as a result of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. The merged facility came under the jurisdiction of the new Joint Task Force National Capital Region/Medical, and in 2013, Navy Medicine National Capital Area was disestablished, with its few remaining facilities transferred to Navy Medicine East. While a 2006 report of the Defense Business Board recommended that the Army, Navy, and Air Force medical commands be merged into a single joint command, citing savings in budget and personnel, this recommendation was not carried out and in 2012 the Defense Health Agency (DHA) was established separately from the military medical commands. All three military medical commands were however all moved to share the new Defense Health Headquarters facility in Falls Church with DHA, again as a result of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure. == Organization == === Departments === The commanding officer of BUMED is the Surgeon General of the United States Navy, a rear admiral. BUMED is divided into ten departments, each referred to with an alphanumerical code. Each of the staff corps is headed by a rear admiral, except for the Hospital Corps, which is headed by a force master chief petty officer because of its status as an enlisted rating. The other department heads are mostly either rear admirals or civilians. * M00: Corps Chiefs ** M00C1: Chief, Medical Corps ** M00C2: Chief, Dental Corps ** M00C3: Chief, Nurse Corps ** M00C4: Director, Medical Service Corps ** M00C5: Director, Hospital Corps ** M00C6: Director, Civilian Corps * Deputy Chief, Total Force (DCTF) ** M1: Manpower and Resources ** M7: Education and Training * Deputy Chief, Business Operations (DCBO) ** Fleet Support & Logistics (M4) ** Information Management & Technology (M6) * Deputy Chief, Resource Management/Comptroller (DCRM/C) ** Deputy Director, Financial Management (M8) ** Assistant Deputy Chief, Capabilities Requirements (M9) * Deputy Chief, Operations, Plans & Readiness (OP&R;) ** M2: Research and Development ** M3: Health Care Operations ** M5: Patient Safety, Clinical Quality & High Reliability/Office of the Chief Medical Officer (M5) === Subordinate commands === Defense Health Headquarters, Falls Church, Virginia Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Virginia Naval Medical Center San Diego, California Naval Hospital Naples, Italy Naval Hospital Yokosuka Japan Naval Health Clinic Charleston, South Carolina USNS Mercy (T-AH-19) off the coast of East Timor BUMED operates the following facilities and commands: *Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, Falls Church, Virginia Naval Medical Forces Atlantic: *Naval Medical Forces Atlantic, Portsmouth, Virginia **Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia **Naval Hospital Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina **Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina **Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay, Guantanamo, Cuba **Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Jacksonville, Florida **Naval Hospital Naples, Naples, Italy **Naval Hospital Pensacola, Pensacola, Florida **Naval Hospital Rota, Rota, Cadiz, Spain **Naval Hospital Sigonella, Sigonella, Italy **Captain James A.
