Benyvirus is a genus of viruses, in the family Benyviridae. Plant serve as natural hosts. There are currently four species in this genus including the type species Beet necrotic yellow vein virus. Diseases associated with this genus include: BNYVV: rhizomania.Index of Viruses - Benyvirus (2006). In: ICTVdB - The Universal Virus Database, version 4.

A pathogen of rice plants, it may cause chlorosis, necrosis, and malformation. * Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (ICTVdB Virus Code: 00.088.0.01.001) * Beet soil-borne mosaic virus (ICTVdB Virus Code: 00.088.0.01.002) * Burdock mottle virus (ICTVdB Virus Code: 00.088.0.01.004) ==Structure== Viruses in the genus Benyvirus are non-enveloped, with rod- shaped geometries. The diameter is around 20 nm, with a length of 85-390 nm. Genomes are linear and segmented, around 6.7kb in length. {| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align:center" |- ! Genus !!

Entry into the host cell is achieved by penetration into the host cell. Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of transcription. The virus exits the host cell by tripartite non-tubule guided viral movement. Plant serve as the natural host. The virus is transmitted via a vector (protozoan). Transmission routes are vector. {| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align:center" |- ! Genus !! Host details !! Tissue tropism !!
