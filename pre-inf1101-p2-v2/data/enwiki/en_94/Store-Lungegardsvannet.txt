Haukeland Universitetssykehus, can be seen to the left in the picture. Store Lungegardsvannet is a bay located in the city and municipality of Bergen in Vestland county, Norway. The bay separates the city centre, located in the borough of Bergenhus, from the southern boroughs of the city, Arstad, Fana, and Ytrebygda. The bay is situated at the end of the Puddefjorden. ==History== The bay is named after the farm of Lungegarden, the estate of the Danish nobleman Vincens Lunge. In the Middle Ages, the bay was named Alrekstadvagen, after the royal farm of Alrekstad. Historically, the lake Lille Lungegardsvannet was located just northwest of the bay, and it emptied into the bay. In the 1930s, the bay, and the area surrounding it, was an attractive recreation for the inhabitants of the city, with boat harbours and beaches. Starting in the 1950s, the bay was seen as a resource for the city to cover the acute need for free, unused land. As a result, there have been several large parts of the bay, mainly on the northern shore, that were filled in. In fact, so much land was filled in that there is no longer any connection between this bay and the lake Lille Lungegardsvannet. There is actually over of land between the now-landlocked lake and the bay. The Nygard Bridge crosses the western end of the bay, as the water flows into the Puddefjorden. ==Commerce== It has a marina (as of 2014).Her kan du fa batplass pa dagen ==References== Category:Fjords of Vestland Category:Geography of Bergen
