To begin a highly touted year, the 2007 Tennessee Volunteers basketball team traveled to Europe and played a few European teams going 4-1 against them. The Vols were hurt when Sophomore F Duke Crews was suspended. Crews suffered a 30-day suspension, but missed both exhibition games with an ankle injury. UT's first exb. game was against the California-Pennsylvania Vulcans, winning handily, 106-46. The University of Tennessee lead the SEC in unrelated Smiths (JaJaun, Tyler, and Ramar). Crews also missed about a month due to heart problems. The Vols finished 31-5, winning the SEC regular season championship, for the first time since 2000. But the Vols lost in the 3rd round of both the SEC and NCAA Tournament. ==Roster== {| class="wikitable" |-style="background: #FF7F00" align=center | Name || Number || Team Position || Height || Year |-align=center | Ramar Smith || 12 || 1 || 6-1 || Sophomore |-align=center | JaJuan Smith || 2 || 2 || 6-2 || Senior |-align=center | Chris Lofton- C || 5 || 3 || 6-2 || Senior |-align=center | Tyler Smith || 1 || 4 || 6-7 || Sophomore |-align=center | Wayne Chism || 4 || 5 || 6-9 || Sophomore |-align=center | J.
