The Best Western Plus Windsor Hotel at 125 West Lamar Street in Americus, Georgia was built in 1892 to attract winter visitors from the northeastern United States. The five-story Queen Anne hotel was designed by a Swedish-born architect, Gottfried Leonard Norrman, working in Atlanta. It featured a hundred rooms and a three-story atrium. It closed in the early 1970s, but later reopened with 53 guest rooms. The Windsor is a contributing property within the National Register Americus Historic District. Vice-President Thomas R. Marshall gave a speech from the balcony in 1917, and the soon-to-be New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke in the dining room in 1928. Former President Jimmy Carter (born in nearby Plains, Georgia) has been a supporter of the hotel since its reopening. ==References== ==External links== * Windsor Hotel Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1892 Category:Hotels in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Buildings and structures in Sumter County, Georgia Category:Hotels established in 1892 Category:Historic district contributing properties in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:National Register of Historic Places in Sumter County, Georgia
