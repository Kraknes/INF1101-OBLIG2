The National Beer Wholesalers Association (NBWA) is a trade association that represents the interests of more than 2,850 beer distributors throughout the United States before government and the public. ==About== Founded in 1938 in the aftermath of Prohibition, NBWA represents nearly 3,000 licensed, independent beer distributors - and their approximately 130,000 employees - who have operations in every state and congressional district across the United States. The organization works to strengthen and maintain the state- based system of alcohol regulation. According to the association's web site, NBWA works to strengthen the state-based system of alcohol regulation that facilitates an orderly marketplace; creates a transparent and accountable system of alcohol distribution that protects American consumers; and promotes responsibility in the manufacture, distribution, sale and consumption of alcohol. The association is led by Craig A. Purser, who became president and CEO in 2005. In 2007, NBWA was named among Washingtonian Magazine's list of "Great Places to Work." NBWA's primary mission is to advocate for state-based alcohol regulation while providing leadership and guidance to America's beer distributors. ==Political action committee== The National Beer Wholesalers Association Political Action Committee (NBWA PAC) is the largest political action committee (PAC) in the licensed beverage industry. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the NBWA's PAC was the second-largest donor to federal candidates in the 2018 election cycle at $3.4 million, behind only the National Association of Realtors. ==References== ==External links== * NBWA.org * BeerServesAmerica.org Category:United States political action committees Category:Trade associations based in the United States Category:Alcohol industry trade associations
