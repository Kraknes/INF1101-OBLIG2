The two volumes of Uneasy Listening are compilation albums by Finnish band HIM, initially issued separately, and then together. ==Vol. 1== Uneasy Listening Vol. 1 contains special versions of various songs from their first four studio albums, most of which have already been released on various editions of their singles and released in October 2006. The album was re- released with a different cover due to legal issues with the original. The album's artwork is by Finnish artist Natas Pop,http://www.allmusic.com/artist/natas-pop-mn0001470991 in emulation of the Art Nouveau style of Alphonse Mucha. ===Sounds and Themes=== The album has been described as "In addition to a handful of remixes (see the ominous Thulsa Doom reworking of "Salt in Our Wounds"), the album presents acoustic renditions of the romance-obsessed songs[...] lushly orchestral takes that vaguely recalls the moody late-1960s work of avant-pop crooner Scott Walker. While not the best introduction to the revered goth/rock band, Uneasy Listening is an excellent HIM rarities collection that is sure to please the group's international legion of diehard fans"http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=7306049&style;=music ===Track listing=== #"The Sacrament" (Disrhythm Remix) - 4:47 #"The Funeral of Hearts" (Acoustic Version) - 4:03 #"Join Me in Death" (Strongroom Mix) - 3:40 #"Close to the Flame" (The Rappula Tapes)* - 4:31 #"In Joy and Sorrow" (String Version) - 5:04 #"It's All Tears" (Unplugged Radio Live) - 3:49 #"When Love and Death Embrace" (AOR Radio Mix) - 3:39 #"Buried Alive By Love" (Deliverance Version) - 6:07 #"Gone With the Sin" (O.D.
