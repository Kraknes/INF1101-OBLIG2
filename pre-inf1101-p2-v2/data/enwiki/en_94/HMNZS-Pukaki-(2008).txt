{| |} HMNZS Pukaki was a Lake-class inshore patrol vessel inshore patrol boat of the Royal New Zealand Navy. Pukaki was launched in Whangarei Harbour on 6 May 2008. Its primary duties include border and fisheries protection patrols, surveillance, boarding operations and search and rescue response. Pukaki was the third ship of this name to serve in the Royal New Zealand Navy and is named after Lake Pukaki. HMNZS Pukaki was decommissioned at Devonport Naval Base on 17 October 2019. Regulatory changes in 2012 resulted in operating restrictions around speed and sea states being imposed on them. Subsequently the RNZN assessed them as no longer being suited to the heavy seas typically encountered off New Zealand and further afield. ==See also== * Patrol boats of the Royal New Zealand Navy == References == ==External links== * Official RNZN Website Category:Protector-class inshore patrol vessels Category:Active patrol vessels of New Zealand Category:Ships built in New Zealand Category:2008 ships
