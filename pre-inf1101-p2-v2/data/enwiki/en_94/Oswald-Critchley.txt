He purchased the Stapleton Ranch which was situated on the Bow River. His first wife, Maria Newbolt, had two sons. She died during the birth of her second son. Critchley quickly remarried to Ms. Winifred Holt. ==Political career== In the 1894 Northwest Territories general election Critchley ran for a seat in the West Calgary electoral district. He defeated two other candidates coming out on top of a close three- way split to capture the district.

He sold his first ranch a year later in 1899 and returned to England. ==Post political life== He moved back to Alberta and returned to ranching. In 1909, he purchased the Bell-Irving ranch in Grand Valley and continued ranching until the outbreak of World War I. He enlisted in the Canadian Army with his two sons.
