COUP-TF1 ( _COUP_ _T_ ranscription _F_ actor _1_ ) also known as NR2F1 ( _N_ uclear _R_ eceptor subfamily _2_ , group _F_ , member _1_ ) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NR2F1 gene. This protein is a member of nuclear hormone receptor family of steroid hormone receptors. == Function == Coup (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter) transcription factor binds to the ovalbumin promoter and, in conjunction with another protein (S300-II) stimulates initiation of transcription. COUP-TF1 binds to both direct repeats and palindromes of the 5'-AGGTCA-3' motif. == Interactions == COUP-TFI has been shown to interact with: * BCL11A, * BCL11B, * COPS2, and * ESR1. ==Clinical== Mutations in this gene have been associated with Bosch-Boonstra- Schaaf optic atrophy syndrome.Hobbs MM, Wolters WC, Rayapati AO (2020) Bosch- Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy syndrome presenting as new-onset psychosis in a 32-year-old man: A case report and literature review.
