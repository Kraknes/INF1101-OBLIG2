Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the IRAK1 gene. == Function == This gene encodes the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1, one of two putative serine/threonine kinases that become associated with the interleukin-1 receptor (IL1R) upon stimulation. This gene is partially responsible for IL1-induced upregulation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Signaling pathway of toll-like receptors. Dashed grey lines represent unknown associations == Interactions == IRAK1 has been shown to interact with: * CHUK * IKBKG * IKK2, * Myd88 * NEMO * SOCS1 * STAT3 * TRAF6 * UBC, * TOLLIP * TLR4 == Clinical significance == IRAK1 signaling is involved in rheumatoid arthritis. == References == == Further reading == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:EC 2.7.11
