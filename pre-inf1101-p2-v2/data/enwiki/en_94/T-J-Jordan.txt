Along with Khadijah Whittington, she led Wilson to its first ever women's basketball state championship game and was named Virginia High School Coaches' Player of the Year. She was named MVP of the 2006 CAA Tournament after setting an NCAA record with ten three-pointers against Northeastern University. Jordan is noted for her adeptness at making three-pointers.

Old Dominion defeated Liberty University in the first round on the 2008 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament, giving the Lady Monarchs their first tournament win since 2002.
