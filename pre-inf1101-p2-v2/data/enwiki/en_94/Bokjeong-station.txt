Bokjeong station is a station on the Seoul Subway Line 8 and Bundang Line. This station has one of the most sophisticated and convenient transfer systems in the Seoul Subway in which the Bundang Line platform is directly beneath the Line 8 platform. Passengers can transfer between the lines simply by taking one flight of stairs/escalators. However, since the station is situated directly below a major highway interchange with no nearby residential or industrial area, the vicinity of the station has no significant source of passengers, so this station is used mainly as a transfer point. The only aboveground section of Line 8 lies between here and Sanseong Station, although both stations are situated underground. The station is within walking distance of Seoul International School in the city of Seongnam; this station is on the border between Seoul and Seongnam. ==Station layout== ===Bundang Line=== {|style="text-align:center;" |- | | Suseo |- || 2 1 |- | Gachon Univ. | |} {| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" frame="hsides" rules="rows" |- !1 | *Bundang Line | for Suwon |- !2 | *Bundang Line | for Cheongnyangni |- |} ===Line 8=== {|style="text-align:center;" |- | Jangji | |- || S/B N/B |- | | Sanseong |} {| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" frame="hsides" rules="rows" |- !Northbound | *Line 8 | for Amsa |- !Southbound | *Line 8 | for Moran |- |} ==Vicinity== *Exit 1: Jangji-dong *Exit 2: Dong Seoul College, Bokjeong-dong *Exit 3: Segok-dong *Exit 4: Garden 5 ==References== Category:Seoul Metropolitan Subway stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1996 Category:Metro stations in Songpa District Category:Seoul Subway Line 8 Category:Bundang Line
