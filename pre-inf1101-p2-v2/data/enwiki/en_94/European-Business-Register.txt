The European Business Register (EBR) is a network of trade registers kept by the registration authorities in most of the European countries. The EBR is part of the fully integrated approach of the European Commission in the legislation designed to achieve regulations to promote transparent financial markets and to facilitate free movement of companies. The EBR has served as a starting point of the Business Register Interoperability Throughout Europe (BRITE) project which developed an interoperability solution BRIS for Business Registers to interact across the European Union. BRIS makes it possible to obtain comparable, official company information from the countries connected to the network. The EBR is at the moment composed of 26 partners and delivers company information from 25 European countries. Amongst others the European Business registers contains remarks about: *legal name of a company *Registered office *people representing the company (Managing Director, Board of Directors, holders of Proxy) *subscribed capital if any. Many scams circulate offering inclusion in the European Business register against payment of a hidden fee, these do not refer to the official register though; inclusion in the European Business Register is free of charge and mostly automatically done by registering a company within one of the partnering countries. {| class="wikitable" |- !colspan=2 bgcolor="#CCCCCC"|Partners of the EBR network |- |---- | | Company profiles and appointments |---- | | Company profiles and appointments |---- | | Company profiles and appointments |---- | | Company profiles and appointments |---- | | Company profiles and appointments |---- | | Company profiles |---- | | Company profiles and appointments |---- | | Not yet available |---- | | Company profiles and appointments |---- | | Company profiles and appointments |---- | | Company profiles and appointments |---- | | Company profiles and appointments |---- | | Company profiles and appointments |---- | | Company profiles and appointments |---- | | Company profiles |---- | | Company profiles |---- | | Company profiles |---- | | Company profiles |---- | | Company profiles and appointments |---- | | Not yet available |---- | | Company profiles and appointments |---- | | Company profiles |---- | | Company profiles and appointments |---- | | Company profiles |---- | | Company profiles |---- |} == See also == * List of company registers * OpenCorporates ==References== * COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION on a simplified business environment for companies in the areas of company law, accounting and auditing, Brussels, 2007-07-10 (PDF, 192 KB) == External links == * Official website of the European Business Register Category:Online databases Category:Databases in Europe Category:Registrars of companies
