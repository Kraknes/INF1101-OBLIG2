Sleeper's College in Chester, Pennsylvania Sleeper's College (sometimes referred to as Sleeper's Business College) was a college founded by Josiah Sleeper in Chester, Pennsylvania, in 1910. In 1971, the college moved a few miles to 2800 Edgmont Avenue in Parkside, where it operated until 1989. A photo, apparently an advertisement, of "Scholars On A Frosty Morning" in front of the original building at 625 Welsh Street describes the college as a "Leading Institution For Office and Commercial Training." The 1944 "Chester Times" yearbook, p. 94, said: > The Sleeper's Business College, located in its own building at 625 Welsh St, > Chester, was planned for educational purposes. The school offers secretarial > and accounting courses to young men and women, and the curriculum of the > public school is open to both young and old. The method of individual > instruction is particularly adapted for the backward pupil. In the 1950s, the ground floor of 625 Welsh was occupied by the Welsh Restaurant, a diner-style restaurant. The building was razed in May 2013.
