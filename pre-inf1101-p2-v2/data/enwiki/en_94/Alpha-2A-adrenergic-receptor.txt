The alpha-2A adrenergic receptor (a2A adrenoceptor), also known as ADRA2A, is an a2 adrenergic receptor, and also denotes the human gene encoding it. == Receptor == a2 adrenergic receptors include 3 highly homologous subtypes: a2A, a2B, and a2C. These receptors have a critical role in regulating neurotransmitter release from sympathetic nerves and from adrenergic neurons in the central nervous system. Studies in mice revealed that both the a2A and a2C subtypes were required for normal presynaptic control of transmitter release from sympathetic nerves in the heart and from central noradrenergic neurons; the a2A subtype inhibited transmitter release at high stimulation frequencies, whereas the a2C subtype modulated neurotransmission at lower levels of nerve activity == Gene == This gene encodes a2A subtype and it contains no introns in either its coding or untranslated sequences. == Role in central nervous system == Although the pre-synaptic functions of a2A receptors have been a major focus (see above), the majority of a2 receptors in the brain are actually localized post-synaptically to noradrenergic terminals, and therefore aid in the function of norepinephrine. Many post-synaptic a2A receptors have important effects on brain function; for example, a2A receptors are localized on prefrontal cortical neurons where they regulate higher cognitive function. ==Ligands== ===Agonists=== * Clonidine * Lofexidine * Dexmedetomidine * Guanfacine * Myrcene *Medetomidine * Xylazine *Tizanidine ===Antagonists=== * Idazoxan * 1-PP (active metabolite of buspirone and gepirone) * Asenapine * BRL-44408 * Clozapine * Lurasidone * Mianserin * Mirtazapine * Paliperidone * Risperidone * Yohimbine == See also == *Adrenergic receptor == References == == External links == * * * == Further reading == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Adrenergic receptors Category:Biology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
