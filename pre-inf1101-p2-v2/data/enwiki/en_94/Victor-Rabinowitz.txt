In 1944, he formed a new firm with Boudin's nephew Leonard Boudin: Rabinowitz and Boudin, currently Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky & Lieberman, in New York City. Rabinowitz and Boudin were the senior partners, joined by Michael Standard, Michael Krinsky, and Eric Lieberman. (Krinsky and Lieberman remain senior attorneys to the present. ) The firm's papers, held by the Tamiment Library of New York University, describes it as follows: > The firm represented numerous labor unions, most notably the American > Communications Association, and assisted clients in passport cases, loss of > employment and other legal matters arising from the targeting of individuals > in government security investigations.
