Neidpath, is a hamlet in Coulee Rural Municipality No. 136, Saskatchewan, Canada. The hamlet is located on Highway 363 and Highway 720 about 25 km east of the city of Swift Current. Neidpath was named after Neidpath Castle, near Peebles, Scotland. The name was suggested by the first postmaster, John Mitchell, whose family emigrated from Peebles. The town was located on a branch line of the Canadian Northern Railway (later Canadian National) that ran to Avonlea, Saskatchewan. During its heyday Neidpath had four grain elevators, two of which still stand derelict today. At one time Neidpath even had its own telephone company, the Neidpath Rural Telephone Central Office, two Chinese hotels and restaurants as well as the King George Hotel along Central Avenue, a pool hall, hardware store, and a blacksmith shop. By 1981, CN had abandoned the rail line. ==See also== * Ghost towns in Saskatchewan * Hamlets of Saskatchewan * List of communities in Saskatchewan * List of ghost towns in Canada ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Saskatchewan Category:Ghost towns in Saskatchewan Category:Coulee No. 136, Saskatchewan
