It was shared with the Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy in its first year of existence. The college bought the building for $25,000 in 1875 and it remains in use as the school's mathematics library after being extensively renovated. The present school dates to 1921. In 1989 an addition was made to the high school which nearly doubled its classrooms. Another addition was constructed during the 2016-17 school year to accommodate the mathematics department. For the most part the hard sciences remain in the older portions of the building and other subjects are dispersed in between halls. The high school started the 2008-2009 year with a new principal, Mr. Nathan Hoven, after the previous principal Dr. Roger Berkbuegler retired after 28 years as the principal of Rolla Senior High School. The current principal is Dr. Jim Pritchett. == Athletics == Rolla High School's Bulldog Athletic teams compete year-round. *Fall sports **Boys Cross Country **Boys Soccer **Boys Football **Girls Cross Country **Girls Volleyball **Girls Golf **Girls Softball **Girls Tennis **Girls Football Cheerleading **Marching Band (including Color Guard) *Winter sports **BoysWrestling **Boys Basketball **Girls Basketball **Girls Winter Cheerleading sports *Spring Sports **Boys Baseball **Boys Tennis **Boys Golf **Boys Track and Field **Girls Track and Field **Girls Soccer **Winter Guard == AP courses offered == *AP Java (AP Computer Science A) *AP European History *AP Calculus AB *AP Chemistry *AP Psychology *AP English Literature and Composition *AP English Language and Composition *AP Music Theory *AP Biology *AP United States Government and Politics *AP United States History *Other AP tests can be taken at the behest of students.
