Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti is a Maori iwi (tribe) on the East Coast of New Zealand's North Island. Its rohe (tribal area) covers the area from Tawhiti-a-Paoa Tokomaru Bay to Te Toka-a-Taiau Gisborne on the East Coast of the North Island of New Zealand. Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti comprises over fifty hapu: from Te Whanau- a-Te Aotawarirangi the northern hapu Tokomaru Bay to Ngati Oneone the southern hapu Gisborne. Many can trace their whakapapa (ancestry) back to Takitimu and Horouta waka (migration canoes) that arrived in Tairawhiti, and back to the famous ancestor Paikea. However, Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti trace their whakapapa from Rongomaituaho, grandson of Uenuku and son of Kahutiaterangi, who captained the Tereanini waka. ==History== ===Early history=== Poupou from the early 18th century (from the iwi Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti), last object of the first voyage of James Cook (1768-1771), gift to Joseph Banks, now at the Museum of the University of Tubingen MUT (Germany) About the 16th century, following major political and social upheavals between the three brothers Taua-Ariki, Mahaki-Ewe-Karoro and Hauiti, Hauiti eventually stamped his mana over Uawa (Tolaga Bay) as it is known to many local inhabitants; hence the title of the major tribal group in this area Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti, meaning the descendants of Hauiti. Local hapu and the Hauiti ariki Whakatataare-o-te-rangi encountered the British explorer Captain James Cook in 1769; including Tupaia the Tahitian who accompanied Cook on his voyage around the Pacific Ocean. According to tribal tradition, Hauiti ariki Te Kani-a-Takirau was offered in 1854 the Kingite Crown, but he declined the offer. ===Modern history=== One of Te Aitanga a Hauiti's more famous modern marae (meeting places) steeped in Maori history is Te Poho-o-Rawiri of Ngati Oneone situated in Gisborne. The origins of Rongowhakaata, the eponymous ancestor, is traced to the area occupied by Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti. Hauiti married the daughter of Rongowhakaata named Kahukura-iti. Titirangi Maunga is the tribe's maunga (revered mountain). Uawa-nui-a-Ruamatua, dividing the township Tolaga Bay and Hauiti, is the tribe's awa (sacred river). ==Notable peoole== Notable members of the tribe include: * Parekura Horomia, Member of Parliament for Labour * Harry Ngata, former All Whites soccer player * Waimarama Taumaunu, former Silver Ferns netballer * John Walsh, artist * Robyn Kahukiwa, artist == See also == * Te Aitanga-a-Mahaki ==References== Category:Gisborne District
