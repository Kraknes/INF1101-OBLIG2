St Aloysius College is a Catholic, day school for girls, situated in Adelaide, South Australia. St Aloysius College, also known as "SAC", was established by the Sisters of Mercy in 1880, and educates over 1300 students from Reception to Year 12. The school is home to the SA Adelaide Language Centre, established in 1994 and accredited by English Australia for English language tuition. ==History== The first Sisters of Mercy were Irish sisters who came to Adelaide from Argentina in 1880, following unrest in Buenos Aires. The same year, the sisters purchased the large home of George Dutton Green in Angas Street, behind St Francis Xavier's Cathedral, and established a convent and school, St Angela's. Part of the order went to Mount Gambier. The original building was extended at various times, and the school was renamed St Aloysius in 1901. In 1920 Mother Cecilia Cunningham received a substantial inheritance from wealthy Argentinian relatives which was used to extend the convent buildings and to build the beautiful chapel. The sisters finally left Angas Street in 2005, at which time the school took control of the entire complex of buildings. ==Notable alumnae and staff== *Dame Roma Mitchell, former Governor of South Australia. *Sister Diedre Jordan AC MBE, former headmistress of the school then long term Chancellor of Flinders University. Now Chancellor Emeritus of the University. *Sister Judith Redden, school principal in 2007.

The surprise hit reached Number 3 on the Australian Singles Chart in 1974 and Number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the same year. ==Social justice== SAC has a Social Justice group for the students and this group leads the school community on social justice issues. During the school year, SAC organises fundraising activities, in particular, the school walkathon, "Mercy Day" and "The Can Drive". Other events often occur during the school year, when social justice issues arise. For example, during the February 2009 Victorian bushfires, students collected clothing and supplies to donate to those affected by the bushfires. == Extracurricular activities == ===Sport=== Students are encouraged to participate in sport during both the summer and winter seasons. For senior students, beach volleyball, basketball, tennis, water polo and softball can be played in the summer, with soccer, netball, hockey and basketball available in winter.

Students are encouraged to learn a musical instrument and join in with the musical ensembles at school. In 2008, a grand piano was bought and the St Aloysius Stage Band and vocalists went on a tour of China. St Aloysius College also attends music events around Adelaide and participates in competitions.
