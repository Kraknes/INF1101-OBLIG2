Artist Management Group (AMG) was a pioneering artist's representation company founded by former CAA head Michael Ovitz, Rick Yorn, and Julie Yorn. Jeff Kwatinetz of The Firm acquired Ovitz' share and merged the two firms in 2002. AMG was a pioneering company with respect to talent management. Previously, powerful talent agencies were known more as large companies while management was handled more personally by smaller outfits. Now there are several companies, such as Management 360, Mosaic Media Group, Untitled Entertainment and Anonymous Content, which function like AMG did. ==References== Category:Talent and literary agencies Category:Defunct companies based in Greater Los Angeles
