Jane and the Lost City was a 1987 UK film, based on the British newspaper strip Jane by Norman Pett. An adventure comedy set during World War II, the film was directed by Terry Marcel, and stars Kirsten Hughes in the title role, Sam Jones, Maud Adams, Jasper Carrott and Robin Bailey. == Synopsis == British Prime Minister Winston Churchill sends Jane (Hughes) and the Colonel (Bailey) on a mission to prevent the diamonds of the fabled Lost City from falling into enemy hands. Journeying to Africa where they are joined by Jungle Jack Buck (Jones), their quest is dogged by Nazi agents Lola Pagola and Heinrich (Adams and Carrott). Jane and the Lost City emulates the mild eroticism of its source material, having the heroine lose items of her clothing several times during the narrative. Despite this, the film was released as PG (Parental Guidance) in the USA. == Cast == *Sam J.
