Hand drawn sketches are combined with found objects, photography, hand-rendered typography and presented in a thought-provoking photomontage. Inspired by music, Surrealism and the Freudian concept of free association, personal experiences and heartbreak, everyday encounters with objects people and places, the current social and political climate, her montages are spontaneous juxtapositions of unlikely things. She incorporates elements of pop culture; viscera, fashion; graffiti; low brow art; hot rod, skate, street and snowboard culture; and eclectic ephemera into her work. The harmonious commingling of both digital technology and fine art techniques has allowed her to redefine and refine her art. ==Publications== * NY Arts Magazine, New York, NY 2011 * p. 146, Basic Identity,Index Book 2010, Barcelona, Spain * p. 142 Graphic Design USA American Graphic Design Award and Publication in 2010 Design Annual, 2010 * p. 0448, 0449 pp. 124, Rockport Publishers/1,000 Music Graphics, 2008 * p. 12, The Black Book/RAW, 2008 * www.zupi.com.br, Zupi, https://web.archive.org/web/20120224182315/http://www.zupi.com.br/publique/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?infoid=1912&sid;=13&tpl;=view_cap_full.htm&from;_info_index=301 Zupi Revista, Brazil 2006 * pp. 80 & 98, Graphic Design USA/2005 Inhouse Design Awards, 2005 == References == == External links == * http://www.rockpub.com/categories/515/Design.html?num_per_page=20&category;_id=515 * http://www.1000musicgraphics.com/ * http://www.scps.nyu.edu/faculty/ddaf/l/0/12928/gina-lucia * https://web.archive.org/web/20110706155253/http://www.zupi.com.br/index.php/site_zupi/view/gina_lucia/ * https://web.archive.org/web/20101227192426/http://globalinheritance.org/programs/read/5/art- of-recycling * http://www.artslant.com/la/events/show/101865-trashed-coachella * http://www.houseofgrfx.com/ * http://www.coroflot.com/public/individual_details.asp?individual_id=302818 * http://www.creativehotlist.com/index.asp?linktarget=fullProfile.asp&indID;=102935 * https://web.archive.org/web/20110102163712/http://www.montclair.edu/profilepages/view_profile.php?username=luciag * https://web.archive.org/web/20101101114514/http://www.gdusa.com/issue_2010/09_sep/winner/index.php Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:American women artists Category:Montclair State University alumni Category:Montclair State University faculty Category:Pratt Institute alumni
