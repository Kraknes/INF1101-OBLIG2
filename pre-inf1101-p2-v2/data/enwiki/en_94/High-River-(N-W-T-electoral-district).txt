High River was a single member territorial electoral district in Northwest Territories Canada that elected members to the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories from 1894 until 1905. ==Electoral history== The electoral district was created under the revised North-West Representation Act that was passed through the Parliament of Canada in 1894. The electoral district was created out of the old Calgary electoral district to meet the requirement of 2,500 residents per electoral district as outlined in the Northwest Territories Act. After Alberta and Saskatchewan were created, the electoral district was abolished in 1905. A new High River district was created to elect members to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. == Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) == {| class="wikitable" |- bgcolor="CCCCCC" | !Name !Elected !Left Office |John Lineham |1894 |1898 |Richard Alfred Wallace |1898 |1905 |} ==Election results== ===1894 election=== {| class="wikitable" |- |colspan=4 align=center |1894 Northwest Territories general election |- bgcolor="CCCCCC" | !Name !Vote !% |John Lineham |328 |76.82% |Frederick James Boswell |99 |23.18% |- |colspan=2|Total Votes |427 |100% |} ===1898 election=== {| class="wikitable" |- |colspan=4 align=center |1898 Northwest Territories general election |- bgcolor="CCCCCC" | !Name !Vote !% |Richard Alfred Wallace |176 |38.51% |Albert Edward Banister |126 |27.57% |Walter C.
