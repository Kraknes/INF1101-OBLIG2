Intwine was a Dutch rock band formed in 2001 by five students of the Tilburg Rockacademie. The band received nationwide notoriety in the Netherlands after lead singer Roger Peterson's participation in the Idols talent show in 2002.Review: Intwine - Kingdom of Contradiction Bart Nijssen, Rocktribune. (Dutch) Subsequently, Intwine charted the Dutch Top 40 five times, with "Happy?" (#3) and "Cruel Man" (#7) being their major hits. During their nine- year career they released four studio albums: Intwine (2003), Perfect (2004), Pyrrhic Victory (2006) and Kingdom of Contradiction (2009). On October 16, 2010, Intwine revealed their breakup through its website. The group's last line-up consisted of Roger Peterson (vocals), Jacob Streefkerk (guitar), Jon Symons (guitar) and Eric Spring in 't Veld (drums). ==History== ===Formation=== Guitarist Jacob Streefkerk and bassist Touche Eusebius were childhood friends at the island of Sint Maarten and played together in several bands before moving to the Netherlands. Both signed in at the Fontys Rockademie of Tilburg in 2001, where they met Aruban vocalist Roger Peterson. These three young musicians, who all crossed the Atlantic, started to play in a roots reggae band, Orange Grove. Beside from their activities in Orange Grove, they also formed their own band "Intwine" in 2001, with fellow students Erwin Gielen (drums) and Kevin Hissink (guitar). ===Breakthrough and first two albums (2002-2005)=== In 2002 lead singer Roger Peterson was a participant in Idols, the Dutch version of Pop Idol, and reached the last ten finalists. Yet he decided to quit the show, after refusing to sign the Idols contract, because it wasn't supposed to allow him to play his own songs and with his own band. For him and Intwine, however, it yielded a lot of publicity and a record deal with Dureco. Regarding Idols, Peterson later said in an interview: "The show has been a friend in court for us (Intwine), but has also been a millstone around our necks. Idols invested a lot in our notoriety and we are grateful for that. However, people relate us with a show that didn't bring any good. Be honest: that show flopped."'Los van het Idols-imago'. Algemeen Dagblad. 20 oktober 2004. (Dutch) Their first single "Happy?" was released in February 2003 in the Netherlands and Belgium and hit the third spot in the Dutch Top 40.

The same year the band composed and recorded the song "Cruel Man" as soundtrack for the Dutch film De Dominee (The Preacher). It was the first single of their second studio album Perfect, released through V2 Records on September 27, 2004. On March 19, 2005, Perfect was awarded with the 3FM Award for best album. "Cruel Man" reached seventh position in the Dutch Top 40 and even became number one in the Turkish charts. Drummer Erwin Gielen left the band in 2004 and was shortly replaced by Jeremy Bonarriba.

Intwine wrote and recorded "Feel It" as the soundtrack for the 2006 movie Nachtrit (Nightrun), which also features Intwine's "For Goodness Sake". "Feel It" was also the first single of their third full-length album Pyrrhic Victory, released on October 9, 2006. About the record, the band stated on their website:"Pyrrhic Victory was recorded with sound artist Gordon Groothedde, who also worked with Intwine on their previous albums. The result is the most impressive project so far. This is a dark record. Spare, without any filler or frills. The gloves are off in songs such as "Cut Me Loose", "For Goodness Sake" and "Solo". Disappointment and pain have seldom been conveyed so beautifully and at the same time as grippingly as they have on this third CD. Yet the record also conveys a genuine fighting spirit. Intwine is rocking harder and sounding more honest than ever."Band biography Intwine Official Home. Due to internal circumstances, record label V2 was not able to promote the album, resulting in the fact that Intwine was only able to sell CD's at their live shows, making that few copies of Pyrrhic Victory were sold. At that time the band was asked by German record label Tiefdruck-Musik, who were impressed after seeing one of Intwine's live shows, to sign to their label and to release Pyrrhic Victory also abroad of the Netherlands.
