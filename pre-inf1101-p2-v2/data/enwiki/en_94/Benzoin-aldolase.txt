In enzymology, a benzoin aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :benzoin \rightleftharpoons 2 benzaldehyde Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, benzoin, and one product, benzaldehyde. This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-hydroxy-1,2-diphenylethanone benzaldehyde-lyase (benzaldehyde-forming)--the systematic name of benzoin is 2-hydroxy-1,2-diphenylethanone. Other names in common use include benzaldehyde lyase, and 2-hydroxy-1,2-diphenylethanone benzaldehyde-lyase. It employs one cofactor, thiamin diphosphate. ==Structural studies== As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and . ==References== * Category:EC 4.1.2 Category:Thiamine enzymes Category:Enzymes of known structure
