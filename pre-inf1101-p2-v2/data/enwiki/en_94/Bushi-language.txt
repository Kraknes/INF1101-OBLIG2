Kibosy (Shibushi or Kibushi) is a dialect of Malagasy spoken in the French- ruled Comorian island of Mayotte. Malagasy dialects most closely related to Bushi are spoken in northwestern Madagascar in the area of Antsiranana (Diego- Suarez) and Mahajanga (Majunga), which is also the closest point in Madagascar to Mayotte. Kibosy and Majunga together are considered one of the Malagasy languages by Glottolog. ==Geographical distribution== Bushi is known as Kibushi on Mayotte and is spoken by 40% of the islands' people (1980). It is spoken alongside the Maore dialect (Shimaore) of Comorian, a Bantu language. Historically, Kibushi and Shimaore have been spoken in certain villages but Shimaore tends to be the de facto indigenous lingua franca in everyday life, because of the larger Shimaore-speaking population. Only Shimaore is represented on the local television news program by Reseau Outre-Mer 1re. Dialects of Bushi in Mayotte (known as Shibushi in Shimaore) include Kiantalaotse and Kibushi-Kimaore (Shibushi-Shimaore in Shimaore). Bushi is spoken along the west coast of the main island (Grande-Terre) including the villages of Bambo Est, M'Boueni, Passy-Keli, Mronabeja, Kani-Keli, Chirongui, Poroani, Ouangani, Chiconi, Sohoa, M'Tsangamouji, Acoua, Mtsangadoua, Handrema. ==Phonology== In Mayotte, Bushi was traditionally written with an informal French-based Latin orthography. On 22 February 2006, the Conseil de la Culture, de l'Education et de l'Environnement de Mayotte introduced an official alphabet that utilizes the basic Latin alphabet without c, j, q, and x and uses three extra letters: b, d, and n.Alphabet du Kibushi Here, the letters used in the orthography are bolded, their IPA counterparts in brackets. On March 3, 2020, the Conseil departemental de Mayotte announced the adoption of official orthographies in both Latin and Arabic scripts for Kibushi. https://cg976.fr/ressources/raa/2020/?file=bulletinofficiel_30032020 https://cg976.fr/ressources/dcp/?file=alphabets-langues-mahoraises === Vowels === Bushi has 5 vowels. {| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;" |+ ! !Front !Back |- !Close |i |u |- !Close-mid |e |o |- !Open |a | |} === Consonants === Bushi has 20 consonants. {| class="wikitable" style="text- align: center;" |+ ! colspan="2" rowspan="2" | ! colspan="2" |Bilabial ! rowspan="2" |Labiodental ! colspan="2" |Alveolar ! rowspan="2" |Palatal ! rowspan="2" |Velar ! rowspan="2" |Glottal |- ! ! ! ! |- ! rowspan="2" |Stop ! |p | | |t | | |k | |- ! |b |b | |d |d | |g | |- ! rowspan="2" |Fricative ! | | |f |s | | | |h |- ! | | |v |z | | | | |- ! colspan="2" |Nasal |m | | |n | | |n | |- ! colspan="2" |Approximant | | | |l | |y |w | |- ! colspan="2" |Trill | | | |r | | | | |} ==See also== *Mayotte: Languages ==Notes== Category:Languages of the Comoros Category:Languages of France Category:Malagasy language Category:Mahoran culture mg:Fiteny Antalaotra
