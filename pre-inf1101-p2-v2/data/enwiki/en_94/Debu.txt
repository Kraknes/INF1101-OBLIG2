Debu is a group of Muslim musicians formed in 2001 and currently based in South Jakarta, Indonesia. Most of the band's members are American, with other members from Indonesia. Some of the original members were teachers at an Indonesian university in Makassar, where the band began informally as a kind of extracurricular activity.http://en.musikdebu.com/history.htm Their band name is in the Indonesian language and means "dust", which is an indication for the listener to avoid focusing on band members because they are insignificant in comparison to the music and the message: "After having already come to know DEBU, we hope people will begin to understand what they are, who they are and why they do what they are doing. But after that, one needs to forget it all because DEBU isn't really anything, nor anybody and there is simply no reason to ask about them. They have come from Him and are in the process of returning to Him. What should be remembered, however, is the message they bring."http://en.musikdebu.com/personnel.htm Debu's music is a mix of sounds of Middle Eastern strings, thumping drums, flutes, violins, santur, flamenco guitar, baglama, tambura, oud, dumbek, electric bass and traditional Indonesian instruments like the Suling Sunda (Sundanese flute). Their music lyrics are about peace, the love and longing to the Creator. "Their long-awaited message of love and peace is not new; to them it's the essence of Islam, the Sufi way."http://en.musikdebu.com/profile.htm Their songs are in Indonesian, Arabic, English, Persian, Turkish, Spanish and Chinese language. They have released five Indonesian albums and one Turkish album. They are often featured on Indonesian TV. ==Discography== ===Albums=== ====Indonesian albums==== * Mabuk Cinta (Drunk with Love) - 2003 ** 1. Ampunilah Saya (Forgive Me) ** 2.
