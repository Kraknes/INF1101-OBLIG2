Ramones Mania 2 is a compilation album by the Ramones that serves as a sequel to the band's first compilation album, Ramones Mania. It includes 25 Ramones songs, from the band's last three studio albums Mondo Bizarro, Acid Eaters and !Adios Amigos! and from the band's third live album Greatest Hits Live. It only features material from when the band was signed with Radioactive Records and had bassist C.J. Ramone in the lineup. Therefore, no material from their 1989 Brain Drain is featured on this compilation, as the band was with Sire Records and had Dee Dee Ramone in the lineup at that time. It was released in 1999 as a Japanese-only release on EMI Japan. It is currently out of print. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Joey Ramone - lead vocals *Johnny Ramone - guitar *C.J.
