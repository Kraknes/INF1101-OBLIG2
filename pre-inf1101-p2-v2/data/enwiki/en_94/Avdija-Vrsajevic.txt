Avdija Vrsajevic (born 6 March 1986) is a Bosnian professional footballer who plays as a right back for Turkish club Akhisarspor. ==Club career== Vrsajevic's first professional club was NK TOSK Tesanj. Here he spent the 2003-04 season before moving to Zeljeznicar. He spent only one season at Zeljeznicar before Celik Zenica acquired his services. He remained at Celik for two seasons, often in and out of the first team. From Celik, Avdija moved to Czech side AC Sparta Prague but never made an appearance for them, spending loan spells initially at SK Kladno and then at 1. FC Tatran Presov. Tatran made his loan move permanent in 2009 and he spent the following two seasons there, making 60 appearances and scoring three goals. He was played as either a right back or a right winger at Tatran. Avdija moved back to Celik in 2011, spending one season at the club where he made a further 21 appearances. As he only signed a one-year contract at Celik and chose not to renew it when the season ended, Avdija moved to Croatian side Hajduk Split, signing a three-year contract. He made his debut for Hajduk on 22 July 2012 in a 0-0 draw against Istra. Immediately becoming the club's first choice right back, Avdija made 30 appearances in all competitions in his first season at Hajduk. In the 2013-14 season, manager Igor Tudor changed his role in the team often. Throughout the season he found himself at left back, right back and right wing, once again making 30 appearances in all competitions. In June 2015, Vrsajevic left Hajduk Split, after agreeing mutual termination with the club. On 18 July 2015, he signed with newly promoted Turkish side Osmanlispor. Three years later, Vrsajevic signed a two-year contract with Akhisarspor. He made his debut in the 2018 Turkish Super Cup against Galatasaray. ==International career== In 2006, Vrsajevic was called to Bosnia and Herzegovina under-21 side by then coach Ibrahim Zukanovic. He made his Bosnia and Herzegovina debut in 2012 in a 3-0 friendly win against Slovenia under coach Safet Susic. Vrsajevic was named in the Bosnia and Herzegovina 23-man squad for their first World Cup participation ever in the 2014 World Cup. On 25 June 2014, he scored his first goal and Bosnia's third in the 83rd minute to make it 3-1 for Bosnia and Herzegovina against Iran in the last group match, where he also made his World Cup debut. ==Career statistics== ===International=== {|class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;" |- !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan="7"|Bosnia and Herzegovina |- |2012||4||0 |- |2013||7||0 |- |2014||4||1 |- |2015||1||0 |- |2016||0||0 |- |2017||1||1 |- !colspan="2"|Total||17||2 |} ===International goals=== :Scores and results list Bosnia and Herzegovina's goal tally first. {|class="wikitable" !Goal!!Date!!Venue!!Opponent!!Score!!Result!!Competition |- |1.||25 June 2014||Arena Fonte Nova, Salvador, Brazil||||3-1||3-1||2014 FIFA World Cup |- |2.||25 March 2017||Bilino Polje Stadium, Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina||||3-0||5-0||2018 FIFA World Cup qualification |} ==References== ==External links== * * Player profile on sparta.cz * Player profile on skkladno.cz * * Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:People from Tesanj Category:Bosniaks of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina footballers Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina international footballers Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina expatriate footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Croatian First Football League players Category:FK Zeljeznicar players Category:NK Celik Zenica players Category:HNK Hajduk Split players Category:AC Sparta Prague players Category:SK Kladno players Category:Czech First League players Category:Expatriate footballers in the Czech Republic Category:1.
