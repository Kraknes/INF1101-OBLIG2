The David Bowie Heathen Tour was a 2002 concert tour in support of the album, Heathen, and was also notable for the performances of all songs from the 1977 Low album. ==History== The Low album, not previously performed live in its entirety, was premiered on 11 June 2002 at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City, together with all the songs from the Heathen album. With other commitments ruling out the possibility of a major concert tour, the Heathen Tour became a mini-concert tour similar to the 1996 Outside Summer Festivals Tour. On 11 February 2002, it was announced that Bowie had accepted the role of Artistic DirectorDavid Bowie appointed Director of Meltdown 2002; 14 to 30 June on London's South Bank at the Meltdown Festival, an annual music and arts event held at the South Bank complex in London, England. David Bowie's Meltdown 2002 ran from 14 to 30 June, with a schedule of concerts and events including performances by The Legendary Stardust Cowboy, Coldplay, The Waterboys and a London Sinfonietta performance of Philip Glass's Low and Heroes symphonies. The closing night was billed as The New Heathens Night with Bowie headlining the event with support by The Dandy Warhols followed by a DJ set from Jonathan Ross. The Heathen Tour proper began at the Meltdown Festival with Bowie embarking on a series of European performances including a link-up with Moby for the 12-date North America Area:2 Festivals with a return to Europe for a further six performances. Before returning again to North America to perform a final seven shows with the first five in each of New York City's five boroughs, dubbed The New York Marathon Tour by Bowie, who joked "I could get home from all the gigs on roller skates".David Bowie Maps His Own New York Marathon == Typical Setlist == #"Life on Mars?" #"Ashes to Ashes" #"Cactus" (Pixies cover) #"China Girl" (Iggy Pop cover) #"Slip Away" #"Sunday" #"Fame" #"I've Been Waiting for You" (Neil Young cover) #"5:15 The Angels Have Gone" #"Starman" #"I Would Be Your Slave" #"Afraid" #"I'm Afraid of Americans" #"Fashion" #"Heroes" #"Heathen (The Rays)" Encore: # * "Everyone Says 'Hi'" #"Hallo Spaceboy" #"Let's Dance" #"Ziggy Stardust" ==Tour band== Bowie performing with Sterling Campbell in Mountain View, California *David Bowie - vocals, guitar, saxophone, harmonica, stylophone *Earl Slick - guitar *Gerry Leonard - guitar, keyboards, backing vocals *Mark Plati - guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, backing vocals *Gail Ann Dorsey - bass guitar, guitar, tambourine (on "Heathen (The Rays)"), backing vocals *Sterling Campbell - drums, percussion *Mike Garson - keyboards *Catherine Russell - keyboards, percussion, backing vocals ==Tour dates== {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;" !
