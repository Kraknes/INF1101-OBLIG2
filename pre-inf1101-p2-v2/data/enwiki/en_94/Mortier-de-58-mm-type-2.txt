The Mortier de 58 mm type 2, also known as the Crapouillot or "little toad" from its appearance, was the standard French medium trench mortar of World War I. ==History== In 1914, Major Duchene of the Engineers (of the 33rd Corps belonging to X Army) proposed to have a tube made which could project a fairly heavy projectile at greater or lesser distances. The idea came to the knowledge of Marshal Joseph Joffre, Commandant Duchene was directed to the Bourges pyrotechnics school to develop the system. It was tested in November of that same year with a 120 mm cast iron shell fitted with fins. Improved and equipped with a 16 kg bomb, the system devised by Duchene gave rise to the 58 mm mortar, and was used from January 1915 after conclusive operational tests. The mortar was used in operations during the Gallipoli campaign. ==Combat use== 3 types of bomb were available:Manual for Trench Artillery. Part V. The 58 No.2 Trench Mortar. US Army, March 1918. Page 9 *Light L.S. bomb - 18 kg, containing 5.35 kg explosive. 6 wings, hollow plugged tail. *Heavy D.L.S. bomb - 35 kg, containing 10.0 kg explosive. 6 wings, hollow plugged tail. *Medium A.L.S bomb - 20 kg, containing 6.4 kg explosive. 3 wings, unlike the other 2 it has a hollow tail which contained the propellant charge, placing thrust closer to center of gravity and increasing range and accuracy. Not yet in common use as at March 1918. Examples of capabilities:General notes on the use of artillery. France. Ministere de la guerre. 1917.
