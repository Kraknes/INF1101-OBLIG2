The Design Automation Standards Committee (DASC) is a subgroup of interested individuals members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Computer Society and Standards Association. It oversees IEEE Standards that are related to computer-aided design (known as design automation). It is part of the IEEE Computer Society. This group sponsors and develops standards under the policies of the IEEE. The group started in the summer of 1984 at the Design Automation Conference. Initially, the group supported VHDL as a standard, but extended its coverage to Verilog, and then additional areas in the design automation space. After going through a period of very few meetings in 2004-06 which ended with some contention about Power standards (see Common Power Format and Unified Power Format), the group developed new and explicit policies and procedures. With these procedures approved in 2007, the group began meeting monthly via teleconference. Active meetings include EDA companies, System integration companies, Electronic Intellectual Property (IP developers, and Semiconductor companies, and individuals interested in these topics. Beginning in 2007, the group began to award the Ron Waxman Design Automation Standards Committee Meritorious Service Award. This award was named after the early and consistently contributing organizer of the DASC, Ron Waxman. The first recipient of the award in 2007 was Gabe Moretti. ==Work of the committee== The biggest center of interest in the DASC has been around language based design and verification standards stemming from the key hardware description language standards VHDL and Verilog. From these have flowed standards for timing, synthesis, math routines, test, power, encryption, and meta-data for the topics above. The emphasis of the group has also grown to embrace standards being developed in analog-mixed signal and other extensions driven by these needs.
