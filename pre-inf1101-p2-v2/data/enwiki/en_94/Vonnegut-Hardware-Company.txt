Employee gathering at flagship store, 120-124 W. Washington St., Indianapolis, IN - 1906, Clemens Vonnegut far left edge with white mustache and Richard E Kremp top row 9th from right The Vonnegut Hardware Company was an Indianapolis hardware store that operated from 1852 to 1965. It was founded by Clemens Vonnegut, Sr., a German former textile ribbon salesman from Amsterdam, who arrived in Indianapolis around 1851. == Indianapolis == At the beginning of the 1800s, the land that would become known as Indianapolis was generally a densely forested wilderness. Indiana was granted statehood in 1816 and four years later the Indiana General Assembly actively sought a site to re- establish a new State capital. In 1821 the Indiana State Legislature had approved both the site and the name Indianapolis. On January 1, 1825 the State capital was moved from Corydon (the territorial and first State capital), to Indianapolis. Indianapolis was incorporated in 1835. By 1830, Indianapolis had grown to a town of approximately 1,000 people.Grooms & Smith's Indianapolis Directory, City Guide and Business Mirror, aka "Indianapolis as I Know It in 1855, First Edition, AC Grooms and WT Smith, Original Repository, Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher IUPUI (campus) University Library In 1850 the population of Indianapolis had grown to over 8,000 people. It was then ranked as the 87th largest urban area in the United States."Table 8 - Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places: 1850", U.S. Bureau of the Census, Internet Release Date June 15, 1998 Generally, Indianapolis area roads in 1850 were dirt, dusty in the summer and muddy in the winter and spring. The surface of the National Road was cobblestone as it ran through the City. Within the "mile square" known as Indianapolis, McAdamized road surfaces and wooden plank road surfaces diverged north and south of the great National Road. Indianapolis was just beginning to be seen as a chief railroad center by 1850. Railroads facilitated trade and brought merchandise and settlers into the area. By 1850 "mechanics of every handicraft" had found their way to Indianapolis and by 1855 the population of Indianapolis had doubled to 16,000 people.Grooms & Smith's Indianapolis Directory, City Guide and Business Mirror, aka "Indianapolis as I Know It in 1855, First Edition, AC Grooms and WT Smith, Original Repository, Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher IUPUI (campus) University Library The Vonnegut Hardware Company benefited from the rapid population growth of the City of Indianapolis. In 1850, just two years before Vonnegut was founded, the City of Indianapolis had a population of 8,091. By 1900 the population of Indianapolis had grown to 169,164 (ranked as the 21st largest urban area in the United States). By 1960 Indianapolis had a population of 476,258."Population of Indianapolis, IN", http://biggestuscities.com, historical population data from the U.S. Bureau of the Census == Early hardware business in the 1800s == In 1852 Clemens Vonnegut, Sr (1824-1906) entered into a partnership with fellow German Charles Volmer opening a hardware store in Indianapolis. Their merchandising store was called C Volmer & Vonnegut Hardware.Grooms & Smith's Indianapolis Directory, City Guide and Business Mirror, aka "Indianapolis as I Know It in 1855, First Edition, AC Grooms and WT Smith, Original Repository, Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher IUPUI (campus) University Library The original establishment was a one-room storefront at 71 West Washington Street or National Road as it was then called. The site was directly opposite the Washington Hall.Grooms & Smith's Indianapolis Directory, City Guide and Business Mirror, aka "Indianapolis as I Know It in 1855, First Edition, AC Grooms and WT Smith, Original Repository, Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher IUPUI (campus) University Library Initially, C Volmer & Vonnegut Hardware would sell hardware, groceries, dry goods, coffin fittings, animal hides and leather, agricultural, carpentry, butcher and harness-making supplies. Much of the merchandise was simply stacked outside on the wooden sidewalk for customers to browse and select. Given many customers arrived only after making arduous journeys, the proprietors would make cheese, crackers and a cool mug of Madison ale available to customers. The cheese, cracker and ale tradition continued from 1852 to approximately 1867.The Indianapolis Star, January 12, 1969 There is some confusion regarding the business departure of Charles Volmer. One accounting is that Volmer left to go out West and was never heard from again.Carl Runyon Clemens Vonnegut Sr. Another version of the story is that Volmer retired in 1857."1893 Indianapolis Illustrated: The Capital City of Indianapolis", Consolidated Publishing, 1893, Original Repository: Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher: IUPUI (campus) University Library"Buys Francke Company - Vonnegut Firm Makes Deal", The Indianapolis Star, September 24, 1910 Clemens Vonnegut's son Franklin would later reflect that Volmer simply went across the street and opened a grocery and liquor business."Franklin Vonnegut Reflects on Life in Hardware Store", The Indianapolis Star, Wednesday, December 31, 1947 Perhaps a part of each story is correct. It appears that Volmer and Vonnegut Sr dissolved their partnership in 1856. By 1857 the retail hardware store was renamed Clemens Vonnegut Hardware and Charles Volmer was no longer affiliated with the enterprise."A C Howard's Directory for the City of Indianapolis; containing a Correct List of Citizens' Names, their Residence and Place of Business", First Issue, A C Howard, Publisher, 1857, Original Repository, Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher IUPUI (campus) University Library In 1858 Charles Volmer was operating a wholesale wine, liquor and cigar distributorship at 95 East Washington Street, Indianapolis.McEvoy's Indianapolis Directory and Business Mirror for years 1858 and 1859, H N McEvoy, Publisher and Compiler, Original Repository, Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher IUPUI (campus) University Library By 1865 there is no longer a record of Charles Volmer in Indianapolis. At about the same time the partnership was dissolved, Clemens Vonnegut moved his hardware store to 338 East Washington Street (between New Jersey and Alabama Streets). He also moved his family into the apartment above the store.A C Howard's Directory for the City of Indianapolis; containing a Correct List of Citizens' Names, their Residence and Place of Business", First Issue, A C Howard, Publisher, 1857, Publisher and Compiler, Original Repository, Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher IUPUI (campus) University LibraryMcEvoy's Indianapolis Directory and Business Mirror for years 1858 and 1859, H N McEvoy, Publisher and Compiler, Original Repository, Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher IUPUI (campus) University Library Vonnegut Sr would not stay at this address very long.

Three of their four sons were born in an apartment above their hardware store. The four children were Clemens Jr (1853-1921), Bernard (1855-1908), Franklin (1856-1952) and George (1860-1952). Franklin often quipped that they probably took him downstairs to weigh him."Franklin Vonnegut Reflects on Life in Hardware Store", The Indianapolis Star, Wednesday, December 31, 1947 In 1866 the Vonnegut Sr family would move to a small home located at 508 East Market Street.

Many hard-working German farmers settled near Indianapolis. Over time, a number came to look at Vonnegut Sr as their friend and trusted advisor. Rather than trust a small, local bank, some would entrust their money to Vonnegut Sr for safekeeping and investment. When the banks had grown stronger and larger and Vonnegut Sr considered them safe, he let it be known that he did not want to continue this depository service. Reluctantly his friends then took their deposits to the bank."Farms of Yesteryear" The Indianapolis Star, May 25, 1952 Sometime around 1874 the business would move to 184-186 East Washington Street Swartz & Tedrowe's Annual Indianapolis City Directory for 1874, Sentinel Company Printers, 1874RL Polk & Company's Indianapolis City Directory for 1879, Original Repository, Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher IUPUI (campus) University LibraryRL Polk & Company's Indianapolis City Directory for 1887, Original Repository, Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher IUPUI (campus) University Library This location was described as being a 22'x195' site upon which stood a three-floor building with basement.Indianapolis Illustrated, 1893, Consolidated Publishing, Original Repository, Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher IUPUI (campus) University Library The new location was in close proximity to the popular Little's Hotel (SE corner Washington and New Jersey Streets)Indianapolis Sanborn Map #5 for the year 1887, Indianapolis Sanborn & Baist Atlas Collection, Original Repository, Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher IUPUI (campus) University Library which was then considered among of the finest hotels in the state. Little's Hotel had a livery service and boasted of an omnibus system drawn by four high-stepping horses. The omnibuses would take travelers between the hotels and the trains arriving and departing from the nearby Union Depot. Close proximity to the Little's Hotel proved beneficial to Vonnegut. By the mid-1800s, Indianapolis' strategic location was seen by many as being the Crossroads of America. Covered Wagons full of ambitious pioneers heading west to seek their fortunes routinely clamored down the cobblestones of the National Road. Many weary travelers stopped to overnight at the Little's Hotel. Many visited Clemens Vonnegut Hardware to pick-up supplies. Vonnegut Sr would purchase property at 342-348 East Washington Street and, so very briefly, move his business to that location in 1898.R L Polk & Co's Indianapolis City Directory for 1898, R L Polk & Co., 23-24 Fitzgerald Building, Indianapolis, Original Repository, Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher IUPUI (campus) University Library In 1899 Vonnegut Sr would once again move his store, this time to 120-124 East Washington Street,R L Polk & Co's Indianapolis City Directory for 1899, R L Polk & Co., 23-24 Fitzgerald Building, Indianapolis, Original Repository, Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher IUPUI (campus) University Library selling his building at 342 East Washington to former US President Benjamin Harrison.The Indianapolis Star, Sunday, May 15, 1927 The new building located on the north side of Washington Street between Pennsylvania and Delaware Streets, had an area approximately 45' x 195' at its base."Indianapolis Sanborn Map #152 for year 1898", Indianapolis Sanborn & Baist Atlas Collection, Original Repository, Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher IUPUI (campus) University Library It was a five- story building with a full basement. Merchandising took place on multiple floors along with administrative offices and storage. When, in 1925, Vonnegut purchased the Lilly Hardware Company (from James W Lilly who had, two years prior, purchased the interest of his business partner, Frank S Stalnaker) it also purchased Lilly's three-story building located at 114-118 East Washington Street. As this location was directly west and adjacent to the Vonnegut store at 120-124 East Washington Street an archway was cut between the two buildings to merge them."Lilly Company Is Sold to Vonnegut - Archway Will Connect Two Stores Which Will Operate as One", The Indianapolis Star, Saturday, July 4, 1925 Even prior to 1900, Vonnegut Sr found it necessary to maintain a separate warehouse. This facility was located at 746 South Delaware St, Indianapolis, IN (west side of Delaware St approximately 50' north of East McCarty Street). The building on this site measured 36' x 150' at its base and was served by a railroad siding along the west end (originally served by the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St Louis Railroad)."Indianapolis Sanborn Map #343 for year 1898", Indianapolis Sanborn & Baist Atlas Collection, Original Repository, Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher IUPUI (campus) University Library"Indianapolis Sanborn Map #119 for year 1915", Indianapolis Sanborn & Baist Atlas Collection, Original Repository, Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher IUPUI (campus) University Library By 1892, sixty-eight-year-old Clemens Vonnegut Sr had ceded the day-to-day operation of his store to children Clemens Jr, Franklin, Bernard and George. While not an official ownership document, the Indianapolis City Directories from 1892 through 1905 listed the four Vonnegut children as principals along with their father.R L Polk & Co's Indianapolis City Directory for 1892, compiled and published by R L Polk & Co., Indianapolis, Original Repository, Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher IUPUI (campus) University LibraryR L Polk & Co's Indianapolis City Directory for 1905, compiled and published by R L Polk & Co., 9-10 Fitzgerald Building, Indianapolis, Original Repository, Indianapolis Marion County Public Library, Digital Publisher IUPUI (campus) University Library By 1899 the firm was no longer referring to itself as Clemens Vonnegut Hardware but rather as the Vonnegut Hardware Company. Katharina Vonnegut died on April 12, 1904. Clemens Vonnegut Sr died on December 13, 1906. In 1908, after the passing of Clemens Sr, his four sons, Clemens Jr, Franklin, Bernard and George filed to incorporate the enterprise as The Vonnegut Hardware Company."Franklin Vonnegut Reflects on Life in Hardware Store", The Indianapolis Star, Wednesday, December 31, 1947 == Hardware firm in the 1900s == Clemens Jr, Franklin and George would work in the hardware store operations on and off for the better part of their lives. Bernard chose to follow a different path attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Polytechnic Institute of Hanover, Germany. Bernard would become a noted architect (Vonnegut & Bohn Architects and later, Vonnegut, Bohn & Mueller Architects). The popular author Kurt Vonnegut was Bernard's grandson.John G. Rauch, "An Account of the Ancestry of Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., by an Ancient Friend of His Family", in Kurt Vonnegut, Palm Sunday: an Autobiographical Collage (1981). In 1908 Franklin "Frank" Vonnegut (third son) took over as the company's president. In one capacity or another, Franklin Vonnegut would continue to work in the business for the entirety of his life."Franklin Vonnegut Reflects on Life in Hardware Store", The Indianapolis Star, Wednesday, December 31, 1947 George Vonnegut would become the secretary and treasurer of the company. Carl Prinzler, an Indianapolis native, was hired by Vonnegut in 1886 (aged 16 years). In 1895 Prinzler was named manager of the art-hardware and building material department. By 1908 Prinzer, working in conjunction with his Indianapolis neighbor, architect Harry H Dupont, would develop and receive US patent protection for what would later come to be known in the industry as panic bar door hardware. Under an arrangement involving the Vonnegut Hardware Company, Prinzler and Dupont, the patents would be assigned to Vonnegut for the manufacture, sale and distribution of what soon would be called the Von Duprin Safe Exit Device. In its first year of production, 1908, Prinzler was selected to supervise the production and assembly of the device. Prinzler was named a director of Vonnegut in 1910. In all, Prinzler would proudly serve Vonnegut for over 50 years. Prinzler died on May 30, 1949."Carl Prinzler, Designer, Vonnegut Director, Dies", The Indianapolis Star, June 1, 1949 In 1906, Richard E Kremp was referred to The Vonnegut Hardware Co by Central (Indiana) Business College. Vonnegut offered Kremp the position of stenographer and bookkeeper in the Accounts Payable Department. Thus began his 54-year association with the company. In 1922 Kremp was named office manager and in 1931 he was elected Treasurer and named to the Board of Directors. In 1932 he became general manager. In 1943 Kremp was elected President of the company and later Chairman of Board, positions he held until his retirement in February 1961.The Try Square - December 1956, published by and for the Employees of The Vonnegut Hardware CompanyF H Johnson Gets New Post at Vonnegut", The Indianapolis Star, Tuesday, Sept 27, 1960 Kremp proved to be a forward-looking executive.

Vonnegut Hardware Company retail stores were a popular and trusted shopping destination. With the advancement of time, Vonnegut changed its inventory to met the needs of a progressive society. Vonnegut sold quality hardware, dry goods, hand and power tools, houseware, cutlery, and kitchen items, vacuum cleaners, sporting goods, radios, watches, gifts, toys, yard and garden tools/supplies, sportswear for men and women and much more. The downtown store also sold firearms, a full line of photography equipment, fireplace fixtures and other specialty items. Through the Vonnegut catalog one could order from even a wider array of items. Vonnegut customers developed the catch phrase "You Can Get It All At Vonnegut's" and the company often used that phrase in its advertising and promotions."For 120 Years It's Service at Vonnegut", The Indianapolis Star, Sunday, January 14, 1973 With the possible exception of The Great Depression years, Vonnegut was in a growth mode from 1887 through the mid-1960s. When Carl Prinzler started his illustrious career at Vonnegut in 1886, he recalls a total work force of under twelve employees. From time to time Vonnegut bought out other hardware stores in the Indianapolis market. It purchased the Francke Hardware Company in 1910 (from Frederick Francke increasing the Vonnegut workforce by one-half to a total of 150 employees).The Indianapolis Star, September 24, 1910 In 1925 Vonnegut Hardware purchased the Lilly Hardware Company (34 new Vonnegut employees)."Friends Surprise Vonnegut Officer As He Enters 51st Year With Firm", The Indianapolis Star, November 2, 1937"Why!

Alfred's son, Robert Obergfell, managed the store as an employee of Vonnegut."Vonnegut buys Obergfell Store - Fountain Square Property Taken Over in Hardware Company Deal". The Indianapolis Star, Friday. February 20, 1931 Under Kremp's leadership, Vonnegut pioneered the concept of "neighborhood selling" by branching out from the downtown Indianapolis flagship store (120-124 E Washington St). In The Great Depression year of 1930, Vonnegut opened its first, full-line neighborhood shopping location in Irvington, approximately five and one half miles due east of the center of downtown Indianapolis. Within a few years Vonnegut had 12 such neighborhood shopping stores within Marion County. Over the years 1930 - 1965, The Vonnegut Hardware Company developed/operated at the following suburban store locations: 5609 E Washington St (Irvington); 3833 N Illinois St; 3416 E 38th St; 3228 E 10th St; 4221 College Ave; 2730 Madison Ave; 1116 Prospect St (Fountain Square);802 E 63rd St (Broad Ripple); 2802 Lafayette RD (Eagledale Shopping Center); 602 Twin Tire Dr (Twin Tire Shopping Center); 5910 Crawfordsville RD (Speedway Shopping Center); 8650 Pendleton Pike (Esquire Plaza Shopping Center); 6101 N Keystone Ave (Glendale Shopping Center); 532 E Pleasant Run Parkway, North Dr; 5331-33 W Washington St; Greenwood Shopping Center (Johnson County) and 13200 N Meridian St (Carmel - Hamilton County).The Indianapolis Star, page 102 of 151, Sunday, November 11, 1961"Vonnegut to Observe 92nd Birthday at His Home", by Ralph H Brooks, The Indianapolis Star, Sunday, October 17, 1948 Within its downtown and neighborhood shopping stores, employees often conducted public do-it-yourself training on such topics as woodworking, plumbing, hobbies and home repair. Oftentimes manufacturer representatives would conduct presentations in the Vonnegut stores showing Vonnegut customers how best to use their products. Vonnegut Hardware Co was a regular exhibitor at trade and public shows such as the Indiana Retail Hardware Association convention, the Indianapolis Sports, Vacation and Boat Show and the Indianapolis Home Show. Vonnegut was also a pioneer in offering customers various credit options such as 30-day accounts, charge plates, weekly or monthly payment terms and budget accounts. In 1940 Vonnegut constructed a new multi-purpose building at 402 West Maryland Street (NW corner of Maryland and Missouri Streets), Indianapolis. Designed by the Indianapolis architectural firm of Vonnegut, Bohn and Mueller, this modern, six-story building contained 350,000 square feet and was built at an approximate cost of $500,000. 402 West Maryland was designed primarily for the mill supply and industrial supply divisions. Mill supply, paint jobbing and other services would move from 120 East Washington Street to the Maryland Street building. Some of the space in this large building was devoted to the manufacture and assembly of the Von Duprin Safe Exit Device. Also this building served as a general warehouse and housed the commercial and industrial sale staffs. This was also the site of administrative offices, an auditorium and an employee cafeteria."The Vonnegut ...

While the retail division generally thrived after The Great Depression years, it provided only a small proportion of the firm's annual sales volume. Vonnegut worked directly with a large number of high quality manufactures who allowed Vonnegut to distribute its products. In turn, Vonnegut maintained a network of several hundred merchant dealers throughout Indiana. These independent retail hardware dealers sold Vonnegut supplied products to their local customers. Thus, Vonnegut supplied products were finding their way into homes and businesses all over Indiana. Vonnegut also maintained the wholesale trade of tools and supplies to contractors directly engaged in the construction trades. The Vonnegut mill supply and industrial supply divisions marketed tools, hardware and supplies directly to commercial clientele and industrial firms within the region. Among its larger industrial clients were: ALCOA (Lafayette and Richmond); RCA Victor (Indianapolis, Bloomington and Monticello); Overmyer Mold Company (Winchester); Lynch Corporation (Anderson); International Harvester (Indianapolis and Richmond) Cummins Engine and Arvin Industries (Columbus), Perfect Circle Corporation (Haggerstown and Richmond); Ball Brothers (Muncie); Allison Division of General Motors Corporation (Indianapolis); Union Carbide and Chemical Corporation (Kokomo); Guide Lamp and Delco Remy Divisions of General Motors Corporation (Anderson); Delco Radio and Delco Battery Divisions of General Motors Corporation (Kokomo and Muncie)."Serving Five States", The Indianapolis Star, May 25, 1952 Through an extensive network of sales representatives, Vonnegut marketed the Von Duprin Safe Exit Device in every principal city in the United States.
