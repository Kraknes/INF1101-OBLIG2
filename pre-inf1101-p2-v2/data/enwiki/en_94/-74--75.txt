"'74-'75" is an acoustic ballad released by American band The Connells from their fifth studio album, Ring. The song was released as the third single from the album in 1993, but it did not chart in the United States. It would later become a European hit for the band in 1995, peaking atop the Norwegian and Swedish singles charts and reaching the top five in the Flanders region of Belgium, Denmark, France, Iceland, and Switzerland. The song's music video, directed by Mark Pellington, features Needham B. Broughton High School's Class of 1975. ==Critical reception== American magazine Trouser Press described "'74-'75" as "so sweet [it] borders on cloying". Rob Ross of Popdose called the song "emotionally-charged and poignant". ==Chart performance== "'74-'75" became a big hit in Europe in 1995, particularly in Sweden and Norway, where it topped the singles charts, as well as in Belgium, Denmark, France, Iceland, and Switzerland, reaching the top 5 in these regions. It ended 1995 as Europe's 23rd-best-performing song, climbing to No. 8 on the Eurochart Hot 100. In addition, it was their only top-20 hit in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at No. 14 in August 1995, and it also became a success in Germany, where it peaked at No. 7 and remained on the airplay charts for 57 weeks. In March 1996, the single re-appeared on the UK Singles Chart at No. 21. Following the songs's success, the Connells embarked on a European tour with Def Leppard. ==Music video== The accompanying music video was directed by Mark Pellington. It was shot at Needham B. Broughton High School in the band's hometown Raleigh, North Carolina in 1993, and features members of the Class of 1975, juxtaposing yearbook pictures with footage of the same people as they appeared in 1993. On November 14, 2015, to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1974-1975 class, a remixed video of the song was released, showing the class members as they look 22 years after the original video was released. ==Formats and track listings== 7-inch single :A.
