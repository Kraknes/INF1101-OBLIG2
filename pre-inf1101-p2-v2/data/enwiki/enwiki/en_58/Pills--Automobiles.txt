Brown's voice in the track is edited with Auto-Tune, making it sound ghosty in his rapped verse.https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7889921/chris-brown- pills-automobiles-new-song-yo-gotti-a-boogie-kodak-black In the song, the artists talk about their relationship with reckless women.https://www.xxlmag.com/chris-brown-yo-gotti-a-boogie-wit-da-hood-kodak- black-pills-and-automobiles/ ==Critical reception== Writing for Billboard, Nerisha Penrose felt Brown's "vocals are bathed in Auto-Tune as he sings about getting high and having multiple women" and "leads into the song's catchy hook". Lindsey India of XXL hears Brown "in his trap music element, spitting some catchy, melodic rhymes over a club-friendly beat", and felt "Gotti comes in with a signature verse of his own, while A Boogie and Kodak provide some of their own crooning towards the end". ==Music video== The accompanying music video was released on August 25, 2017. It was filmed in Splash Kingdom Waterpark in California, where the visual for Justin Bieber's 2012 song "Beauty and a Beat" was also filmed. It shows Brown and his dancers dancing in a shallow pool, intercut with scenes of women twerking. Gotti came on the scene surrounded by women. A Boogie later hopped into the pool and sat on an inflatable float as he raps, while Black had a party elsewhere and rides a dirt bike. "No one knew it was shot and that Chris Brown was on site that day," said Pamela Kennedy, a representative for park owners. "We understand the importance, especially for videographers and artists, to provide a suitable environment to shoot and do their craft." ==Charts== === Weekly charts === {| class="wikitable sortable plainrowheaders" style="text- align:center" |- ! scope="col"| Chart (2017-18) ! scope="col"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class="wikitable plainrowheaders sortable" |- !
