Ahmed ibn Merwan was a lieutenant in Kerbogha's army at the time of the First Crusade. After the capture of Antioch by the Crusaders, Ahmed was entrusted with maintaining control of the still Turkish-held citadel within the city after Shams ad-Daulah, son of the governor Yagisiyan, fled. Following the Battle of Antioch, in which Kerbogha's forced were crushed, Ahmed offered to surrender the citadel to the Crusaders. However, as he refused to allow any prince's banner but Bohemond's to be flown over the citadel, it appears as though he had maintained a secret truce with Bohemond in the effect of a Crusader victory against Kerbogha. Following the transfer of the citadel to the Christians, Ahmed joined the ranks of the Crusaders and even converted to Roman Catholic Christianity. == References == Category:11th-century Turkic people Category:Muslims of the First Crusade Category:Christians of the First Crusade Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Islam
