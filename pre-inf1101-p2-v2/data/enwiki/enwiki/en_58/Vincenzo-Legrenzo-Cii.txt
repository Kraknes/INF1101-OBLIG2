Vincenzo Legrenzo Ciampi (Piacenza, 2 April 1719 - Venice, 30 March 1762) was an Italian composer.Van Boer 2012, p. 131. Ciampi's middle name "Legrenzo" is frequently misspelled "Legrenzio", an error by Fetis 1860, corrected by Fetis & Pougin 1878. He is best known today for a work that cannot be certainly ascribed to his pen, the song "Tre giorni son che Nina in letto senesta", formerly called Pergolesi's "Nina".Osborne 2012, p. 205. ==Education and early career in Italy== Ciampi studied at the Naples Conservatorio della Pieta dei Turchini with Francesco Durante and Leonardo Leo.Van Boer 2012, p. 131. His first known success was the comic opera Da un disordine nasce un ordine, performed at the Teatro dei Fiorentini in Naples in 1737, when he was only eighteen.Walker 1954. Five more of his comic operas were produced in Naples up to 1745, and he also received commissions for operas to be presented in Rome and other Italian cities. In 1746 he was engaged as a harpsichordist at the opera house in Palermo,Van Boer 2012; Libby et al 2001. and his opera seria Ataserse was performed there in 1747.Walker 1954; Libby et al 2001. That same year he was engaged at the Ospedale degli Incurabili in Venice as an assistant to the maestro di coro G. B. Runcher, whom he had succeeded by 1748.Libby et al 2001. Ciampi is given this title in the libretto to his 1748 opera L'Adriano. ==London== Ciampi was one the first music directors of the Ospedale to be given extended leave, and by the autumn of 1748 he was in London. His replacement at the Ospedale was Gioacchino Cocchi. In London Ciampi was the composer and director of music for a company of Italian singers under G. F. Crosa, who presented the first season of Italian comic opera at the King's Theatre, London.Libby et al 2001. The company's repertory consisted of works already presented in Venice, among which was Gli tre cicisbei ridicoli in which appeared the popular song "Tre giorni son che Nina", often attributed to Pergolesi. This caused Barclay Squire and others to suggest the song was actually composed by Ciampi, however, according to Frank Walker, "this is extremely doubtful".Walker 1954. See also Walker 1948; Squire 1914; Squire 1899; Libby et al 2001. Ciampi continued to appear in London until 1756.Marshall 2003, p. 233. ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * Fetis, Francois- Joseph (1860).
