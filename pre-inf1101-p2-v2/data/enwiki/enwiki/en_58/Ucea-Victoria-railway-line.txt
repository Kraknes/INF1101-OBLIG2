The Ucea-Victoria railway line is a Romanian standard gauge single-track railway branching from Ucea railway station on CFR line 200, at above sea, and heading South towards Victoria city, at above sea. It is currently used only for freight transport by Viromet S.A. in Victoria. ==History== The birth and development of the railway was closely linked to that of Ucea (later Victoria) Chemical Plant. As a preliminary work, by Decree-Law nr. 3456 from 20 September 1939,Published in Monitorul Oficial nr. 223 from 26 September 1939. the Armament Endowment Ministry was allowed to lend CFR 90 million lei for repairing and strengthening the railway between Podu Olt and Ucea in order for it to sustain heavier traffic. The birth certificate of the line was Decree- Law nr. 3667 from 7 October 1939,Published in Monitorul Oficial nr. 236 from 11 October 1939. allowing the construction of a new railway line for Ucea- Fabrica in Fagaras County. Thus, CFR was to build the line from Ucea de Jos to Ucea-Fabrica on behalf of the Armament Endowment Ministry. Every religious, art or charity institute on the way was allowed and encouraged to make available any necessary land. One month later, by Royal Decree 3991 from 7 November 1939,Published in Monitorul Oficial nr. 262 from 11 November 1939. the line was declared public utility in the interest of national defense. Any expropriation necessary was expedited while at the same time any property of the State, Land or Commune on the way was to be ceded for free. By the end of 1939 the line was operational, with the following characteristics:1930-1940: un deceniu de realizari C.F.R., "13. Linia Ucea de Jos - Ucea Fabrica". * normal gauge single track; minimum curve radius of ; maximum grade slope of 25 %0; 34.5 kg/m rails * 37,500 m3 of embankments and track ballast; 15 small bridges, totaling * 3 stations with station buildings for passengers (Ucea de Jos, Ucea de Sus, Ucea Fabrica); 5 section houses * telephone line and signalling equipment * build at a cost of approximately 5,750,000 lei/km Until 1951 it held only freight traffic.Bellu (1995), p. 215. In 1950-1951, the tracks were replaced with 40 kg/m rails.Bellu (1995), p. 217. By the Order 573/100 of Ministry of Transportation from 31 May 1951,Published in Foaia Oficiala a Ministerului Transporturilor nr. 5 from 12 June 1951. from 1 June 1951 the line was officially opened for passenger traffic between Ucea and Ucea Fabrica, as line 39 bis in the timetable, with the following stops: * Corbi (halt) at from Ucea * Ucea de Sus (halt) at from Ucea * Ucea Colonie (halt) at from Ucea * Ucea Fabrica (station) at from Ucea For passengers, there were 4 pairs of mixed trains, increased to 5 in the following yearsMinisterul Cailor Ferate, Mersul trenurilor Valabil dela 4 oct. 1953.Ministerul Cailor Ferate, Mersul trenurilor Valabil dela 3 oct. 1954. and then reduced to 3 in 1956Ministerul Cailor Ferate, Mersul trenurilor 30 September 1956 - 1 June 1957. and just 2 by 1959-60.Caile Ferate Romine, Mersul trenurilor 31 May 1959 - 28 May 1960. All trains usually had a number of freight wagons, sometimes followed by 2 passenger wagons, and they were pulled by steam locomotives (CFR 326 series from 1939-1954, CFR 50.000 series from 1954-1966) or diesel locomotives (CFR LDM 20.000 series from 1940-1966, CFR DA 060 series and others after 1966).Bellu (1995), p. 219. Between 1952-53, a new station, named Ucea (halta),Ministerul Cailor Ferate, Mersul trenurilor Valabil dela 3 oct. 1954. was built to the South of Colonia Ucea (future Victoria city), at kilometer 8.978. In 1953-54 Ucea Colonie station was reduced to a single track and the line between Ucea Colonie and Ucea Fabrica was dismantled, the latter station being closed. Thus, after passing Ucea Colonie, the trains entered Ucea (halta) and with a pinched loop operation continued their way to the factory, on the old line, connected with Ucea (halta) at kilometer 8.4.Bellu (1995), p. 216. In October 1955, by the Order 24177/1955 D.G.M./C.Published in Foaia Oficiala a C.F.R. nr. 53 from 15 October 1955., Corbi halt was moved at from Ucea, while Ucea Colonie and Ucea (halta) were renamed Victoria (halta) and Victoria respectively, reflecting the changes in the city's name. At the same time, Ucea Fabrica station was closed. Thus, the new stops on the Ucea-Victoria railway line were: * Corbi (halt) at from Ucea * Ucea de Sus (halt) at from Ucea * Victoria (halta) (halt) at from Ucea * Victoria (station) at from Ucea In 1960 all passenger traffic on the line has ceased, being taken over by a bus line.Caile Ferate Romine, Mersul trenurilor 29.V.1960-27.V.1961. All intermediary stations between Ucea and Victoria were closed. In 1962 the line was renumbered as 225.Caile Ferate Romine, Mersul trenurilor 27.V.1962-25.V.1963. In 1969 the tracks were replaced with 49 kg/m rails, fixed on new concrete sleepers.Bellu (1995), p. 219. ==Description== Freight traffic continues to this day on this line. In Ucea station, the line to Victoria branches from track 2, with track 1 as siding. After crossing DN1, the line heads South, by the side of DJ105C, to Victoria station where it enters on the main track 3. Tracks 1 and 2 are sidings in connection to Ucea, while track 4 heads only to the Chemical Plant (which is possible from the first three tracks as well). All switches in Victoria station are hand-operated. Inside the Chemical Plant, the railway complex measures approximately of tracks, with a local station, locomotives depot, and wagons revision facilities.Bellu (1995), p. 216. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * ==External links== * Dashcam video of the entire line from Victoria to Ucea Category:Industrial railways in Romania Category:Standard gauge railways in Romania Category:Railway lines opened in 1939
