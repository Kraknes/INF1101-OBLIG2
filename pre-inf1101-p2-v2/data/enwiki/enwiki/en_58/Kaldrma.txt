The so-called Steinbeiss Railway, built mainly to service the fledgling timber industry, branched off past Drvar, further to Jajce and Prijedor. After WWII, in 1948 the section Knin-Kaldrma was upgraded to a normal gauge in order to become a part of a new Una railway Knin-Bihac- Novi Grad, an important rail link between Zagreb and Dalmatia. Old narrow- gauge line towards Drvar branched off from Una railway in Kaldrma. While other narrow-gauge sections further east were gradually closed, amidst heavy lobbying and protests from locals, Kaldrma kept its old link to Drvar until May 28, 1978, when the last train arrived from Drvar to Kaldrma station. In 1987, Una railway was electrified. Traffic on Una railway was only sporadic during the Croatian war of independence (1991-5) due to the breakaway Serb Krajina blockade. After 1995, traffic was not reintroduced due to the damage and difficulties concerning numerous border crossings on the line. ==Nature == A lake situated northwest from Kaldrma railway station is believed to be a rare example of bifurcation;Zadarski list Damir Maricic: Prica o dvije rijeke, 3. rujna 2009., preuzeto 20. lipnja 2011. namely, some of the lake's water ends up in the Black Sea via Una river, while some of it flows into the Adriatic via Krka river. == Literature == * Savezni zavod za statistiku i evidenciju FNRJ i SFRJ, popis stanovnistva 1948, 1953, 1961, 1971, 1981. i 1991. godine. * Knjiga: "Narodnosni i vjerski sastav stanovnistva Hrvatske, 1880-1991: po naseljima, author: Jakov Gelo, izdavac: Drzavni zavod za statistiku Republike Hrvatske, 1998., , ; ==References== Category:Populated places in Zadar County Category:Lika Category:Serb communities in Croatia
