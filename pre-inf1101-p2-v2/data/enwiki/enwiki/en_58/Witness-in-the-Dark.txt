On the staircase, Jane accidentally brushes against the killer. Later, when Jane inherits the valuable brooch from Mrs. Temple, she finds herself targeted by the intruder. ==Cast== * Patricia Dainton as Jane Pringle * Conrad Phillips as Inspector Coates * Madge Ryan as Mrs. Finch * Nigel Green as the Intruder * Enid Lorimer as Mrs. Temple * Richard O'Sullivan as Don Theobald * Stuart Saunders as Mr. Finch * Noel Trevarthen as Sergeant Jones * Maureen O'Reilly as Sophie Trellan * Ian Colin as Superintendent Thompson * Larry Burns as Carter * Ann Wrigg as Woman Neighbour * Frazer Hines as Newsboy ==Critical reception== The Radio Times wrote, "Coming between Bachelor of Hearts and Village of the Damned, this is one of Wolf Rilla's lesser efforts. However, he conjures up a pleasing sense of menace that anticipates Wait until Dark as he subjects blind telephonist Patricia Dainton to the murderous machinations of a prowler. As so often in thrillers of this kind, much depends on contrivance and the script might have concealed its hand with a little more artfulness. But Dainton's performance is superior to that seen in the majority of British Bs"; TV Guide on the other hand, found it "Standard and predictable," though agreed that "Dainton gives a nice performance"; while NoirWorthWatching described the film as "efficiently directed," and concluded that it "in many ways is more of a movie than its 62-minute length might suggest. Very much worth watching." ==References== ==External links== * Category:British crime drama films Category:1959 films Category:1959 crime drama films Category:Films directed by Wolf Rilla Category:British black-and-white films Category:British films
