Devegecidi Bridge, also known as Kara Kopru and Sultan Murad IV Koprusu is a disused stone bridge of seven arches across the Devegecidi stream north of Diyarbakir, in southeast Turkey, on the road to Ergani. There is a separate bridge across the same stream that is often also called the Devegecidi Bridge to the east, near the stream's confluence with the Tigris river. There are three inscriptions on the southern portion of the bridge, one of which indicates that it was built in 1218 by the Artuqid ruler Melik Salih Nasireddin Mahmud. The bridge is made entirely of basalt blocks, some finely dressed others less so and has seven pointed arches, of which the southern two are the broadest. Deve Gecidi Bridge was last repaired in 1972. ==Footnotes== ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:Bridges completed in the 13th century Category:Deck arch bridges Category:Anatolia Beyliks bridges Category:Buildings and structures in Diyarbakir Province Category:Stone bridges in Turkey Category:Tourist attractions in Diyarbakir Province Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 13th century Category:Arch bridges in Turkey Category:Bridges in Diyarbakir
