Los de la Nazza are a Puerto Rican urban music duo formed in 2005 by Eliezer "Musicologo" Garcia and Eduardo "Menes" Lopez. The duo achieved significant popularity in the Latin urban music field during the late 2000s and early 2010s as producers of Puerto Rican rapper Daddy Yankee, combining elements of reggaeton music with electronica influences. Musicologo is Daddy Yankee's cousin. The producers were joined as a duo by Daddy Yankee in 2007, and their first production credit was on his studio album El Cartel: The Big Boss, released later that year. Los de la Nazza continued working with Daddy Yankee until 2014, having produced songs including "Pose" (2008), "La Despedida" (2010), and "Lovumba" (2011). Musicologo and Menes began producing a series of mixtapes titled El Imperio Nazza released from 2012 to 2016. They turned independent in 2014 in order to focus on their own careers, and released their first studio album Orion in 2015. ==History== Musicologo, born Eliezer Garcia on December 21, 1981 in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, was raised in the Nemesio Canales Residential, where he first experienced the violence and rawness of the streets.
