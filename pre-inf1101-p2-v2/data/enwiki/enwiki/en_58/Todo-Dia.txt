Recorded in Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, the song's chorus says as it follows: "I don't wait for the Carnival to be a slut, I am every day". According to Vittar, "[Being a slut] means 'to be yourself everyday without worrying about opinions of others.'" == Controversy == On August 1, 2017, the music video of the song was removed from YouTube after Rico Dalasam filed a lawsuit against the producers, claiming 100% of the music royalties. On August 9, the song was removed from all digital platforms, including Spotify. == Reception == The public's reception was very positive, in the week it was released, Todo Dia peaked at number 3 on Spotify's Viral 50 Global. The song soon rose to success, being one of the most played of Brazilian 2017 Carnival. Vittar performed the song with Anitta and Daniela Mercury in carnival blocks. == Music video == The music video was released on January 20, 2017, being produced by the Studio Farandola, and with general direction by Guilherme Batista and Fabricio Sassioto, who were also responsible for post production.
