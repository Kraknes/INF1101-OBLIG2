Drawing of the Baptist College, the section to the far right being the only remaining evidence of the building A 2010 photograph showing the remains of the Chapel frontage The Baptist College, Stepney, was opened in Stepney in the East End of London in 1810 by the Particular Baptists. Its buildings included rooms for tutors and students, a refectory, a library and a chapel. The college relocated to larger premises at Holford House in 1856 and became Regent's Park College. The only remaining structure is the largely-destroyed Baptist Academical Institution chapel. The building remained until it was damaged during World War 2; only three parts of the college estate remain.2 The site is currently part of the Stepney City Farm. Crossrail works are taking place there.Structures at King John Street, Stepney Green, London E1 (Stepney College and Stepney Meeting, or Congregational Church) Museum of London Archaeology Service ==References== Category:Stepney Category:Regent's Park College, Oxford Category:Educational institutions established in 1810 Category:1810 establishments in England
