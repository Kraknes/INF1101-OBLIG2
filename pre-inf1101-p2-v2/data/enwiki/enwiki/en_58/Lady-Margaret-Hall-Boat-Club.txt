Lady Margaret Hall Boat Club (LMHBC) is a rowing club for members and staff of Lady Margaret Hall (LMH), Oxford and was founded in 1976. == History == LMHBC first competed in inter-college OURCs racing events in 1977, when a women's division was finally established (LMH was a women-only college for the first 100 years of its foundation). As the senior women's college LMH was placed first on the river for the inaugural women's division. It is run by an executive committee, which is elected annually by members of the club at that time. It is affiliated to Oxford University Rowing Clubs (OURCs). The club shares a club room and boat house on Boat House Island, Christ Church Meadow with Trinity College Boat Club. The building also houses the Linacre College Boat Club and Magdalen College Boat Club. The club has provided rowers for the Boat Race, the Women's Boat Race, and the Isis Reserves Race. A former president, Monica Fisher (nee Pring-Mill) was responsible for instigating some of the biggest changes in Women's Boat Race history, which raised the regularity and status of that event. For a period around 2010 three times World Lightweight Sculling Champion Peter Moir Haining coached LMHBC. LMHBC is the largest sports club within Lady Margaret Hall. The club is affiliated to British Rowing. == Results == LMH Men's 1st VIII 2019 The club fields a Men's First VIII and a Women's First VIII in the annual inter-collegiate Torpids and Summer Eights bumps racing competitions, along with second and, from time to time, third VIIIs.

A men's third VIII is periodically fielded. The Men's 1st VIII have raced in the Temple Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta on several occasions. Other external regattas include Head of the River Race, Wallingford Head, and Henley 4s and 8s Head. === Women's crews === Eight's week in Oxford The LMHBC women's first VIII had the Summer Eights headship in 1977, the inaugural year of women's inclusion in Summer Eights as recognised, distinct divisions.
