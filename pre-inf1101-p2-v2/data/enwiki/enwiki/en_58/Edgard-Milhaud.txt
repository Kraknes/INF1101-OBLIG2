His parents were Jassuda Leon Milhaud (1839-1901) and Marie Victoire dite Sarah Cerf (1850-1901).

From 1899 to 1902 Milhaud was an economic adviser in the office in the Minister of Commerce and Industry. He married Berthe Louise Marquinot (1880-1978) on 14 April 1901. Their children were Maurice Edgard, born in 1899, and Germaine Sarah, born in 1901. In 1902 he was appointed Professor of Political Economy at the University of Geneva.

In 1914-18 he was the first doyen of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences. In 1920 Milhaud was asked by the International Labour Organization (ILO) to direct the Survey of Production (1920-24). In the early 1920s Albert Thomas and Edgard Milhaud proposed to develop expertise in the ILO on the links between social and economic problems. As the delegate representing the French employers at the ILO, Robert Pinot despised the proposal, which he called "social control of the economy." In 1923 Milhaud became a member of the Honorary Committee of the International Co-operative Alliance. In 1924 he was a member of the Higher Consultative Committee of Commerce and Industry of France. From 1925 to 1933 Milhaud was Chief of the General Investigations Section of the ILO. In 1926 he gave a course at the Academy of International Law of The Hague.

On 20 June 1940 Edgard Milhaud, Adrien Tixier and Jean-Amedee Weber sent a telegram to Marshal Petain in protest against the request for an armistice, asking for the continuation of the war alongside the British. In 1947, while teaching at the University of Geneva, Milhaud founded the International Centre of Research and Information on the Collective Economy, now known as CIRIEC, to ensure continuity of the Annals of Collective Economy. In 1948 Milhaud was a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1957 the headquarters of CIRIEC were moved to Liege, Belgium, and Professor Paul Lambert became director.
