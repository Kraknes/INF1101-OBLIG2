Mangelia cingulata is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Mangeliidae.Strebel, H. 1908. Die Gastropoden (mit Ausnahme de nackten Opisthobranchier). Wissenschaftliche Ergebnisse der Schwedischen Sudpolar-Expedition 1901-1903 6(1): 111 pp., 6 pls ==Description== The length of the shell attains 7.7 mm, its diameter 2.6 mm. The solid, brownish shell is turriform. The apex is broken off, but 10-11 whorls appear to have existed. These are steeply angulated with a suture impressed below the lowest strongest spiral. Three such spirals are present on the whorls in increasing strength. Another four of decreasing strength show a slightly larger interstice on the body whorl. Between the spiral ribs are fine, extensively extended ribs in the direction of growth, but they become mostly indistinct by a fibrous cuticle. ==Distribution== This marine species occurs off Uruguay and South Georgia. ==References== ==External links== * Tucker, J.K. 2004 Catalog of recent and fossil turrids (Mollusca: Gastropoda).
