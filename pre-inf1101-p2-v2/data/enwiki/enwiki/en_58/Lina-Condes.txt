Lina Condes (Ukr. Lina Kondes; born 3 November 1988, Cherkassy city, Ukraine) is a Ukrainian artist. Condes's work displays attributes of feminist context, minimalism, surrealism, and pop art, infused with autobiographical, psychological, and sexual content. Condes speaks about her own intimate experiences, about humans, the internal life of the feminine being -- things that touch us directly. She travels between Kiev, London, Miami and New York. == La Biennale di Venezia == Condes presented "Sphinx", an interactive sculpture in which a watchful eye merges with a stylized body observing what surrounds it, sometimes with benevolence, sometimes with malevolence, during 57th International Art Exhibition - La Biennale di Venezia. == Career == 2020 Christies' group show "Educate",NYC 2019 Christmas Public Art Installation.
