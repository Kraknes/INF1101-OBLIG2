Personal Nightmare is a horror adventure game developed and published by Horror Soft for the Amiga, Atari ST and MS-DOS in 1989. It was released digitally by Adventure Soft on July 2, 2009 on GOG.com. ==Plot== There is no direct plot, but the game focuses on a town where The Devil has invaded and the player has four days to eliminate all possessed citizens (led by a witch and a vampire) and finally purge the evil by defeating the Devil himself before he can take over. ==Gameplay== The game makes use of a combination of text-based commands, clickable verbal commands and clickable objects to progress. A compass indicates which directions the player can travel. Much of the game's movement and actions are real-time based so there is a day and night cycle. The player's inventory can be viewed in the respective menu. There are many encounters that can kill the player (ideally at night time) unless the player performs a proper action to avoid them. Newer versions of the game omitted the encounters where the players gets garroted. The player loses the game if four days pass and all the required possessed citizens have not been killed and the devil has not been repelled. ==Reception== Personal Nightmare was generally well-received, including the ratings of 87% by Zzap! (Amiga), 84% by Computer + Video Games (Amiga and Atari ST), 74% by CU Amiga (Amiga) and 7/10 by Datormagazin (Amiga). ==References== ==External links== *Personal Nightmare at Atari Mania *Personal Nightmare at Lemon Amiga *Personal Nightmare at the Hall of Light Category:1989 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Amiga games Category:Atari ST games Category:DOS games Category:English-language-only video games Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox Category:Horror video games Category:ScummVM supported games Category:Single-player video games Category:The Devil in fiction Category:Vampire video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games featuring female antagonists Category:Video games about witchcraft
