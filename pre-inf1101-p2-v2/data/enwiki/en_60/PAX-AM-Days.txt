The album featured a greater emphasis on pop music than the band's previous releases. They supported the record by promoting it with a nationwide Monumentour and performing on various TV shows. In July, Fall Out Boy visited Adams' Los Angeles studio to play punk rock; the existence and release of the EP was confirmed less than half a year after Save Rock and Roll's release.

The room was set up the way the band practiced in guitarist Joe Trohman's parents' attic during their early days. Lead singer/guitarist Patrick Stump enjoyed the accidental nature of the two-day session: "It's analog, it's just tape; [Adams would] be rolling the tape, like 90 percent of the time, even when we weren't sure what was happening. We would rehearse a song and then be like 'Alright, let's take it!' And he's like 'We're good, we got that one!'"Fall Out Boy On Ryan Adams Hang: 'Somehow Some Music Got Recorded' MTV.

Speaking of the musical direction of the studio session, Trohman said "Misfits, Black Flag, Descendents, Dag Nasty, anything real late-70s, early-80s punk and hardcore stuff was influential in the creation of the music, and I think even the lyrical content too. That was the inspiration behind the entire session--to emulate the stuff that we grew up on, and the stuff that Ryan grew up on." The first digital single, "Love, Sex, Death", was described as "a fiery slab of early-80s punk and early '90s hardcore".Fall Out Boy On 'The Rage And Passion' Of Pax-Am Days MTV.
