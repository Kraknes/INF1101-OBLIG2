In addition to Barrymore, it also stars Blanche Sweet, Dorothy Gish, Marshall Neilan, Antonio Moreno, and Jack Mulhall. This was Mulhall's first theatrical film role; he portrayed a juvenile character which the titular discord centered on. The film was produced by Klaw & Erlanger and Biograph Company. The screenplay was written by F. E. Woods from a play by William C. deMille, and was produced by Marc Klaw and Abraham Erlanger. The film is a silent two-reeler. Cinematographer Tony Gaudio was nearly fired during production after he attempted to reproduce the glow cast from a fireplace, rather than employing the fixed, flat lighting that was accepted practice at the time. ==Release== The film was released theatrically on December 13, 1913 by the General Film Company. A reviewer for The Moving Picture World wrote that it "will be readily appreciated by women" and that it is a "woman's story" which "reaches its most effective emotional passages in showing the influence of a mother over a daughter who is on the verge of making a serious mistake." ==Preservation status== The House of Discord is now in the public domain. A print of the film survives at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. ==References== ==External links== * *The House of Discord at SilentEra Category:1913 films Category:Films directed by James Kirkwood Sr. Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films based on plays Category:1913 drama films Category:American films Category:American silent short films Category:American drama films
