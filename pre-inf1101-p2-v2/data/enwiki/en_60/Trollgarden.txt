Trollgarden is a glacial moraine in the municipality of Hjelmeland in Rogaland county, Norway. The moraine is a tall ridge of stones, rocks, and boulders that runs for about from the east side of the lake Kvivatnet across the moorland to the northern side of the mountain Brendeknuten in the Hjelmelandsheiane mountains. The name "Trollgarden" is translated to English as The Troll's stone fence since it looks like a rock wall that a troll may have built around its farm. The ridge sits about southeast of the village of Josenfjorden and about northeast of the village of Hjelmelandsvagen. ==Access== In the old days, people thought it was magic powers such as trolls that had built the massive stone fence far into the Hjelmeland moors. The geological explanation is that, when the glacial ice retreated, the stones were deposited in the mountains. To see Trollgarden, one must hike for about two hours to reach the moraine. The tall ridge is clearly visible in the bare mountains, at an elevation of just over above sea level. ==Geology== The geology of the Trollgarden area was thoroughly investigated and described by Professor Bjorn G. Andersen in his Master's thesis (1954) (On the glacial retreat in the area between the Lysefjorden and Josenfjorden in Ryfylke). ==See also== *List of mountains of Norway *Terminal moraine *List of glacial moraines ==References== ==External links== * Geoprofiler: En bauta i norsk geologi by Jan Mangerud at Geoforskning.no * Trollgarden - Steingard med dimensjoner * Trolsk mote med Trollgarden * Map of Trollgarden 2008 Category:Landforms of Rogaland Category:Moraines of Europe Category:Glacial deposits of Norway Category:Hjelmeland
