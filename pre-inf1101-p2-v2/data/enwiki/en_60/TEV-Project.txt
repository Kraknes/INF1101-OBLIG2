The TEV Project logo The TEV (Tracked Electric Vehicle) Project is an initiative developing technologically advanced highways capable of handling the transportation of people and light freight more efficiently. TEV's design is a compact, electrified infrastructure that would continually power conventional, rubber tire electric vehicles such as cars, taxis, vans and minibuses and allow them to operate under software control. == Concept == The concept combines the latest in enabling technologies such as driverless vehicles, dynamic charging and Smart city data modelling to propose an evolution of current highway/motorway infrastructure. On the electrified track network (the term "track" referring to restrictive, single lanes of traffic and not rails or railway tracks), EVs would be 'autonomous' or computer- driven. This allows for vehicles to be grouped closely together, described by some as 'convoying' or 'platoons'. Computer operation would allow vehicles to travel safely at high speeds. These factors give TEV an extremely high passenger carrying capacity which, in theory, outperforms existing transportation models, including traditional roads, high-speed trains and various forms of Personal Rapid Transit (PRT). TEV is a dual mode design. "Dual mode" vehicles would be capable of operating on the track as well as being driven manually on normal roads, accessing tracks via entry/exit points. Only compatible, safety-checked cars would be admitted at track entry points. "Single mode" vehicles would stay on the track at all times. Single mode vehicles would provide on-demand public transport and car sharing with stations or stops along the track network. == Designer and Founders == The TEV concept was 'soft launched' by its designer Will Jones at the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure World Congress in Berlin, and following positive feedback and media coverage, TEV Project was incorporated in 2014. Jones is an inventor, an expert in battery design and founder of Philadelphia Scientific, a provider of products and services for industrial batteries and electrical infrastructure, operating in North America, Europe, Southeast Asia and Asia-Pacific. Jones founded the project alongside his daughter Caroline Jones Carrick who directs the project's day-to-day activities. == Awards == TEV Project was presented with the 2016 award for "Best Innovation Project" by the Smart Transportation Alliance (STA) at their annual conference and awards ceremony in Brussels. The accolade, set up by STA, celebrates key leaders and business professionals in the field of smart transport and infrastructure, recognising projects and businesses across the globe that look to inspire and advance transportation. Receiving the award at the ceremony on February 3, 2016, director Caroline Jones Carrick said, "We are thrilled to have been awarded the Best Innovation Project at this year's STA awards...we are extremely grateful to the STA for the acknowledgement." TEV is a 2014 Spark Design & Architecture Award Winner as judged by a panel of industry luminaries including the Design Director of Tesla Motors, Inc.http://www.transport-network.co.uk/Scottish-electric- vehicle-project-up-for-international-award/11099 In 2014 following coverage in the Indian media and interest from the Indian Roads Congress, the project was nominated for two Parivartan Awards honoring businesses, charities, projects and individuals creating a more sustainable India. Project director Jones Carrick was named a finalist for the Sustainability Trailblazer Award. TEV Project was recognised by the European Union's 'A World You Like' contest ranking as one of the UK winners for Europe's most pioneering projects helping to create a low carbon society. == Media coverage == The initiative has featured on BBC Autos, BBC Radio, BBC Radio Scotland, The Sunday Times, The Daily Express, The Herald, The Scotsman and a number of specialist environmental and transport publications, including Better Roads,http://www.betterroads.com/tracked-electric-vehicles-the-future-of- transportation/ Sustainability Outlook India, Sustainuance, Plugincars.com. and The City Fix,http://thecityfix.com/blog/friday-fun-automated-roads-next- transport-revoultion-climate-electric-innovation-technology-iman-abubaker/ The Positive, Electronics Specifier and more. == Project Status == The project is currently developing technology in partnership with Newcastle University. The project has presented to a wide range of professional audiences, including the US Federal Highway Administration over a two-day period for the Exploratory Advanced Research workshop in novel surface transportation held at Turner- Fairbank Highay Centre.http://automotive.electronicspecifier.com/around-the- industry/tev-project-to-present-to-us-department-of-transportation == External links == * http://www.tevproject.com/ == References == Category:Electric vehicle infrastructure developers
