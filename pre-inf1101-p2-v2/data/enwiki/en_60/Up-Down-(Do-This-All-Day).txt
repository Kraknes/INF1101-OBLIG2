Here we go!" You > know, I've been working with B.o.B since before he got signed really. It's > been a good time. It's been really collaborative with us. At the time, it > wasn't the right songs or the right situation. Now, that I had something > good so it was only right. I don't make people conform to what I'm doing > when I got to get somebody. When you get T-Pain, you don't really want to > tell T-Pain what to do. If you got in mind what you want T-Pain to do, you > could've done it yourself.
