Samantha Florence "Sam" Bailey (born 29 June 1977) is an English singer, who won the tenth series of The X Factor in 2013. Following her win, her debut single, a cover of Demi Lovato's "Skyscraper" was released on 15 December 2013, achieving the Christmas number one on 22 December 2013. She was the first X Factor winner in three years to gain the Christmas number one spot. On 24 February 2014, Bailey supported Beyonce on one of the dates of her UK leg of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour, as well as performing on The X Factor Live Tour. Her debut album, The Power of Love, was released in March 2014 and debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. The album was re-issued in December 2014 as The Power of Love (The Gift Edition). The re-issue featured five new tracks--including three Christmas covers and a reworking of original song "Treasure". In support of the album, Bailey went on her first headline tour in January and February 2015. == Early life == Bailey was born in Bexley, London to parents Ronnie (1950-2008) and Jackie Bailey. She has two brothers, Charlie and Danny. Ronnie died from oral cancer in 2008. Sam grew up in Sidcup, London and attended Cleeve Park School and Bexley College. Before auditioning for The X Factor, she worked as a prison officer at HM Prison Gartree near Market Harborough, Leicestershire. In an interview on Daybreak the day after winning, Bailey said that she would quit her job at the prison. == Career == === Early career === In 1996, then 18-year-old Bailey formed the ska duo Girls Next Door with her friend Julie Nunney and they recorded a song called "Too Late", which was produced by Right Said Fred bassist Clyde Ward. It was reported that Simon Cowell heard the song but turned the duo down because they were not on television, but Bailey later said that this story was not true. === 2013: The X Factor === In 2013, Bailey auditioned for the tenth series of The X Factor in front of judges Gary Barlow Sharon Osbourne, Nicole Scherzinger and Louis Walsh, singing Beyonce's "Listen" in her room audition. She received a standing ovation from all four judges afterwards, with Barlow calling her voice "incredible". She was given four "yeses" and progressed through to the arena auditions. She sang "Who's Lovin' You" and "Run To You" at the arena, gaining another standing ovation from the audience and bringing Scherzinger to tears. She received four yeses again. Bailey was placed in the "over 25s" category at "bootcamp" and was mentored by Osbourne. She successfully made it through to "judges' houses" and was later chosen by Osbourne for the live shows, along with Lorna Simpson and Shelley Smith. Following the eliminations of Simpson in week 1 and Smith in week 2, Bailey became the last over 25 in the competition. On 8 December, she made it to the final along with Nicholas McDonald and Luke Friend. On 14 December, she duetted with Scherzinger on "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going". The following night, she sang her winner's single, a cover of "Skyscraper" by Demi Lovato. Later, having received more than 1 million votes over the course of the weekend, she was announced as the winner. When the voting statistics were announced on The X Factor afterwards, Bailey was revealed to have received the most public votes seven times out of ten. As the winner, she received a PS1 million recording contract with Syco Music and the opportunity to support Beyonce on the UK leg of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in February 2014. Bailey was reportedly due to support Beyonce at ten shows, but that figure was cut down to just one due to The X Factor Live Tour. Her sole show with Beyonce was in Birmingham on 24 February 2014. A report by The Sun claimed that Bailey had "misled the public" by stating she had no previous singing experience, when in fact she had been performing on cruise ships, in clubs and at music festivals for several years. Bailey defended herself in an interview with the Leicester Mercury, stating: "I have been totally honest that I have sang for 20 years but never made it. What's the problem with that?" An X Factor executive producer also revealed that Bailey had auditioned for the show's fourth series in 2007, but did not get past the first producers' round. {| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed" style="width:100%; margin:1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center;" |- ! colspan="4" style="background:#BFBFBF;"| The X Factor performances and results |- ! style="text-align:centre;"| Show ! style="text-align:centre;"| Song choice ! style="text-align:centre;"| Theme ! style="text-align:centre;"| Result |- !
