The second, third, fourth and fifth episodes were watched by 10.6%, 11.0%, 10.4% and 11.4% of the viewing audience respectively. ===Critical reception=== David Butcher of Radio Times said the following about the first episode: "The trouble is, none of it makes a lot of sense, and the long, colourful speeches that writer William Ivory gives Tompkinson can't save the drama from clattering oddness." Sarah Rainey, writing for The Daily Telegraph gave it four out of five stars, called it a "bitter-sweet offering" and said: "The script offered a good mix of humour and poignancy, and there were also some unexpectedly lovely scenes of the countryside". Ellen Jones of The Independent said: "The laboriously regional script didn't make it any easier. The dialogue was so crammed with earthy wisdom and quaint sexual euphemisms that the actors struggled to get a breath in." and "Truckers' debt to films such as Brassed Off and The Full Monty was made obvious". ==International broadcasters== In Australia the series premiered on 23 April 2015 on BBC First. ==Home media== The DVD edition was released on 3 February 2014. ==References== ==External links== * * * * Truckers Trailer Category:2010s British drama television series Category:2013 British television series debuts Category:2013 British television series endings Category:BBC television dramas Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series by All3Media Category:Television shows set in Nottinghamshire
