Following Beasley's senior season, he was named ACC Defensive Player of the Year. In 2016, Beasley was named to his first Pro Bowl and All-Pro honors, following his league-leading 15.5 sack season. ==Early years== Beasley attended Adairsville High School in Adairsville, Georgia, where he was a three-sport standout in football, basketball, and track. He played as running back and linebacker for the Adairsville Tigers high school football team. He was named All-county and All- area in both his junior and senior seasons.

Beasley chose Clemson over Alabama, Auburn, and Stanford. ==College career== ===Freshman season=== Upon arriving at Clemson in 2010, Beasley was redshirted. He began working as a tight end. Due to Beasley's size and speed, he was also used as a scout team quarterback in his redshirt year. ===Redshirt freshman season=== As a redshirt freshman in 2011, Beasley played sparingly. In nine games, he only played 16 snaps and recorded two tackles on the season. ===Redshirt sophomore season=== As a sophomore in 2012, Beasley recorded 18 tackles and a team-high eight sacks. He was named an Honorable Mention Sophomore All-American by College Football News. ===Redshirt junior season=== Through the first six games of his junior season in 2013, Beasley led the nation in sacks with 13. Beasley was a first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) selection and was named a consensus All-American. Beasley and the Tigers upset #6 Ohio State Buckeyes in the Orange Bowl. Beasley opted to stay his senior year to finish his education instead of declaring for the 2014 NFL Draft. He was projected to have been picked up in the second round as predicted by the NFL's draft advisory board. Beasley entered the year with 21 career sacks, which was seven away from setting the all-time school record for career which was set by Michael Dean Perry and Gaines Adams at 28. In October, he broke the record. He was named the ACC Defensive Player of the Year and was again a consensus All-American. ==Professional career== ===Atlanta Falcons=== ====2015 season==== Prior to the draft, Beasley was praised for being an explosive athlete who was always first off the snap. Many scouts viewed him as a true edge bender who could torque his hips and shoulders to turn the corner. He was also recognized for his ankle flexion to dip and slalom around the corner at difficult angles to block. On the other hand, critics said Beasley lacked ideal arm length. They said he was too often content to stay blocked if his pass rush stalled out. Others said he needed to shed blocks more consistently against run. While many noted his good football character, some scouts were concerned about a lack of alpha-dog tenacity.http://www.nfl.com/draft/2015/profiles/vic-beasley?id=2552301 Beasley was selected with the eighth overall pick by the Atlanta Falcons in the 2015 NFL Draft.
