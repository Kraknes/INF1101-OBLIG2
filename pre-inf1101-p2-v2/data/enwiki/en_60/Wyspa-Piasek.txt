Islands in WroclawWyspa Piasek (English: Sand Island ) in Wroclaw, is one of several islands in the Odra river within old town and Srodmiejski Wezel Wodny (Downtown Water Junction). With the left bank of Oder river and old town of Wroclaw Wyspa Piasek is connected by a Piaskowy Bridge, and with Ostrow Tumski by Tumski Bridge. The island has an area of about 5 hectares. Only one street runs across the island (St. Jadwiga street, between Piaskowy Bridge and Mlynskie Bridges). On the island is one of several Biblioteka Uniwersytecka (University Library) building (former Augustinian monastery), an old gothic Church of Saint Anna (in 1810 rebuilt to hospital and next to residential building), a baroque Church of Saints Cyril and Methodius (in 1810 here was transferred the church of Saint Anna) and the watermill Maria. In the old days Wyspa Piasek was densely built-up, however during the last month of the Second World War many of these buildings were destroyed. ==See also== * Church of St Mary on the Sand * St. Cyril and Methodius Church (Wroclaw) ==External links== * Category:Districts of Wroclaw Category:River islands of Europe Category:Islands of Poland
