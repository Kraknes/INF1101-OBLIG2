The X Factor was an Australian television reality music competition, based on the original UK series, to find new singing talent; the winner of which received a Sony Music Australia recording contract. The sixth season premiered on the Seven Network on 13 July 2014 and ended on 20 October 2014. Luke Jacobz returned as host, while Ronan Keating, Natalie Bassingthwaighte, Dannii Minogue and Redfoo returned as judges. Comedy duo Luke & Wyatt joined the sixth season as the hosts of the online spin-off show The Fan Factor. The winner was Marlisa Punzalan and her winner's single "Stand by You" was released after the final. Punzalan became the youngest winner of the show at 15 years old and was the first contestant from the Girls category to do so. She was mentored by Keating, who won as mentor for the second time after previously mentoring season two winner Altiyan Childs in 2010. Open auditions in front of the show's producers took place in 13 cities from November 2013 to January 2014. The successful auditionees chosen by the producers were then invited back to the last set of auditions that took place in front of the judges and a live studio audience in April 2014. Following auditions was super bootcamp, where all four judges worked together and collectively chose 24 acts, including six from each of the four categories: Boys (male soloists aged 14 to 24), Girls (female soloists aged 14 to 24), Over 25s (soloists aged 25 and over) and Groups. After super bootcamp was the home visits round, where each judge reduced their six acts to three, with assistance from guest mentors James Blunt, John Legend, Jennifer Lopez, Jessica Mauboy and Nicole Scherzinger. The live shows began on 10 August 2014. This was the first season of The X Factor Australia to feature a wildcard in the live shows as the thirteenth finalist. ==Judges== In 2014 it was confirmed that Minogue, Redfoo, Bassingthwaighte and Keating will return for the series. ==Selection process== ===Auditions=== Open auditions in front of the show's producers took place in 13 cities and ran from November 2013 to January 2014.

Filming began in late April 2014. The first day of bootcamp saw judges Ronan Keating, Natalie Bassingthwaighte, Redfoo and Dannii Minogue split each category into collaborations. The male and female soloists were put into ensembles of four within their category, the Over 25s were put into ensembles of three, and the acts from the Groups category were put into pairs. Each collaboration was given a list of songs which they had to choose from and only had 24 hours to rehearse. On the second day, each collaboration performed their chosen song for the judges. At the end of the day, a select group of soloists from the Boys and Girls categories were first requested by the judges to return to the stage to form a boy band (consisting of Ellis Hall, Harry Targett and Joel Watson) and a girl group (consisting of Serenity, Tahnie Cristini, Chaska Halliday and Nada Leigh Nasser). The judges then sent home half of the 100 acts. On the third day, each judge found out which category they would be mentoring, and the remaining 48 acts each had a one-on-one mentoring session with their mentor. Bassingthwaighte was given the Boys, Keating was given the Girls, Redfoo was given the Over 25s and Minogue was given the Groups category. On the fourth day, each act individually performed one song to the judges and a live audience of one thousand. On the fifth and final day of bootcamp, the judges revealed which acts they put through to home visits. The 24 successful acts were: *Boys: Jaymie Deboucherville, James Johnston, Adrien Nookadu, Dean Ray, Tee, Jesse Teinaki *Girls: Alice Bottomley, Sydnee Carter, Shanell Dargan, Chloe Papandrea, Marlisa Punzalan, Caitlyn Shadbolt *Over 25s: Reigan Derry, Jason Heerah, Ryan Imlach, Rochelle Pitt, Stephanie Totino, Amali Ward *Groups: Brothers3, MajikHoney, Paris Inc., Trill, XOX, Younger Than Yesterday ===Home visits and wildcards=== The final round of the selection process, the home visits, saw each judge take their remaining six acts to exclusive locations around the world. Bassingthwaighte and Keating took the Boys and Girls to New York City, Redfoo took the Over 25s to Las Vegas, and Minogue took the Groups to an exclusive location in Sydney. On the first day, each act had a one-on-one mentoring session with their mentor. Minogue was assisted by Jessica Mauboy during the mentoring sessions for the Groups. On the second day of home visits, each act performed one song to their mentor and guest mentor. Bassingthwaighte was assisted by American Idol judge Jennifer Lopez, Keating was assisted by John Legend, Redfoo was assisted by former X Factor UK judge Nicole Scherzinger (who got replaced by Mel B as of UK Series 11, and Minogue was assisted by James Blunt. After the performances, the judges along with their guest mentors, narrowed down the acts to three each. On the third and final day, the judges revealed which acts they put through to the live shows.

Redfoo chose to send home Tee because he felt that Tee had not found himself as an artist yet.

Tee was eliminated as the act with the fewest public votes. ; Notes * This week's live decider aired on Tuesday night due to the Seven Network's coverage of the 2014 Brownlow Medal. *For the first time in the show's history, and only for this week, the final showdown in the live decider consisted of a bottom three. *On 27 September 2014, the performances of four acts entered the ARIA Singles Chart.

Their version was released on the iTunes Store on 29 September 2014, as a charity single to help raise funds for You Can to establish specialised youth cancer centres across Australia. ==Reception== ===Controversy and criticism=== XOX were criticised by Keating and Redfoo after their performance of Deee-Lite's "Groove Is in the Heart" during the third live show. Redfoo said they look "like a pop act but it's not sounding like a pop act", while Keating said their performance was lacking and "just didn't feel it fired, it just didn't happen. You've got to get it right." However, Bassingthwaighte disagreed with their comments and said she loved the performance. The criticism divided the judging panel as "it quickly became a battle of the sexes". XOX's mentor Minogue told Keating that she was personally offended by his comments because she felt it was hypocritical as he did not like her criticising his acts. She then went on to say, "We took on board the feedback [from last week] so we took this song and did a club remix of it. If you're not used to that and you don't go to clubs anymore because you're too old then I'm sorry." Following XOX's elimination in week four of the live shows, Minogue stated that she believed the group were the victim of unwarranted criticism, saying that "Other acts have faltered but have not had the same criticism. I feel really strongly about that." In an interview with TV Week, group member Nada-Leigh Nasser believed that Keating's consistently negative comments could have played a part in their elimination: "Ronan is very influential and his opinion does matter. We accept any criticism we get because we know it's all constructive in the end. But we do acknowledge that it would affect a lot of people's opinions." More controversy occurred after Reigan Derry's performance of Radiohead's "Creep" during the ninth live show, when Minogue criticised Derry's outfit for being too oversexualised. Derry, who used to be a member of the girl band Scarlett Belle, had stated in her audition for The X Factor that she felt people did not get to see the real her because of how oversexualised the band was. Minogue told her: "I watched again your first audition and I listened to every word you said. You know, oversexualised and you just wanted to sing the song and you just wanted everybody to listen to your voice. In the close-ups of this outfit, if you don't want to be oversexualised...I'm getting mixed messages." Derry's mentor Redfoo defended her outfit by saying that it was not oversexualised, before taking aim at Minogue's outfit. He said, "Look what you're wearing! You want to talk about oversexualised, look what you're wearing! Let's get real. Let's get really real. This is see through!" During the ninth live decider show the following night, Redfoo apologised to Minogue for the comments he made about her outfit. Minogue accepted his apology and said "I've had a chat with Reigan and we've sorted it out. We are all moving on." ===Ratings=== {| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align:center" ; Colour key: : - Highest rating during the season : - Lowest rating during the season |- ! scope="col" bgcolor="yellow"| Week ! scope="col" colspan="2" bgcolor="yellow"| Episode ! scope="col" bgcolor="yellow"| Original airdate ! scope="col" bgcolor="yellow"| Timeslot ! scope="col" bgcolor="yellow"| Viewers (millions) ! scope="col" bgcolor="yellow"| Nightly rank ! scope="col" bgcolor="yellow"| Ref. |- ! scope="row" rowspan="3"| 1 | 1 ! rowspan="6"| "Auditions" | || Sunday - || 1.226 || #2 || |- | 2 | || Monday - || 0.970 || #8 || |- | 3 | || Tuesday - || 1.245 || #2 || |- ! scope="row" rowspan="3"| 2 | 4 | || Sunday - || 1.274 || #4 || |- | 5 | || Tuesday - || 1.166 || #3 || |- | 6 | || Wednesday - || 1.079 || #4 || |- ! scope="row" rowspan="3"| 3 | 7 ! rowspan="3"| "Super Bootcamp" | || Sunday - || 1.114 || #5 || |- | 8 | || Tuesday - || 1.107 || #2 || |- | 9 | || Wednesday - || 0.914 || #6 || |- ! scope="row" rowspan="3"| 4 | 10 ! rowspan="3"| "Home Visits" | || Sunday - || 1.035 || #5 || |- | 11 | || Monday - || 1.055 || #6 || |- | 12 | || Tuesday - || 1.088 || #4 || |- ! scope="row" rowspan="2"| 5 | 13 !
