During this time he took every opportunity to get close to movie production, gatecrashing the sets of Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut and George Lucas' Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. In the late 1990s, Nooshin travelled to New York and spent much of his time at famed method acting institute The Actor's Studio, watching luminaries such as Arthur Penn take drama classes. In 1999, his short film Panic, based on a true story of a carjacking gone awry, played at several international film festivals and opened doors with industry executives in London and Los Angeles. Soon after, Nooshin began writing feature scripts and signed with talent agency CAA. He was represented by Verve. ==Breakthrough== In 2008 Nooshin's script for Last Passenger was voted onto the Brit List of favourite unproduced British screenplays. It later became a $2.5m film starring Dougray Scott. Nooshin received a nomination for the Douglas Hickox Award For Best Debut Director at The British Independent Film Awards.https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/06/british-film-the-last- passenger In a 2013 interview for his former college Nooshin expressed his view that "The film industry is built on a cultural fault line where the tectonic plates of art and commerce meet. As a filmmaker you should anticipate and be prepared to tough out frequent tremors and the occasional earthquake." http://www.ucreative.ac.uk/news/2013/october/lastpassenger#.Uma59SROmUN ==Death== Nooshin died suddenly on 15 January 2018 at the age of 43. ==Filmography== ===Feature films=== * Last Passenger (2013) (writer, director) * Redivider (2016) (writer) ===Short films=== * Panic (1999) (writer, director, composer, actor, producer) * Rooftop (1996) (writer, director, composer, producer) ===Awards=== {| class="wikitable" width="80%" !
