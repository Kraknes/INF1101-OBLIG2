The Best Mouse Loses is a 1920 silent short theatrical cartoon by Bray Productions featuring Krazy Kat. ==Plot== A boxing match is about to begin, and Ignatz Mouse is one of the featured fighters. But Ignatz has no intention of winning when he tells a canine buddy he will go down purposely, and therefore asks the latter to wager his sack of cash on it. The rodent and the dog agree on the idea before entering the venue. Momentarily, Krazy Kat arrives just outside the venue. He then meets a girl mouse who happens to be a sister of Ignatz. The girl mouse says to Krazy she'll be wagering her family's fortune that her brother would emerge victorious. She also requests him to make sure Ignatz prevails which Krazy accepts with pleasure. The boxing match begins, and Krazy is the referee. Ignatz and the opponent, however, start with some bizarre acts like dancing which prompts Krazy to tell them to actually fight. After the opponent makes a feeble contact, Ignatz drops deliberately, pretending to be knocked cold. Not wanting to disappoint the girl mouse, Krazy counts extremely slow until Ignatz is saved by the bell, much to the mouse's surprise. The second round starts but the fighters still hardly engage. After the contenders make a few moves, Krazy strikes and knocks down the opponent using his tail. He then counts out the opponent, and declares Ignatz the winner. Ignatz is infuriated by the bout's outcome, and therefore pummels Krazy with punches. ==See also== * Krazy Kat filmography ==References== ==External links== * The Best Mouse Loses at the Big Cartoon Database Category:1920 films Category:1920 animated films Category:American black-and- white films Category:American films Category:American silent short films Category:Animated sports films Category:Krazy Kat shorts Category:American boxing films Category:1920s American animated films Category:Films featuring anthropomorphic mice Category:Films directed by Vernon Stallings Category:American animated short films
