Omen is an EP by American metalcore band Within the Ruins. It was released via Victory Records on May 24, 2011. It features two new songs and two covers. Omen would be the band's last release featuring Mike Beaujean on bass and Mike Van Schelt on guitar. Additionally, it would be the last release to feature two guitarists, with Cocchi taking over sole guitar duties in 2013's full length Elite. It would also be the band's last release for Victory Records, as they would go on to sign with eOne Music in November 2012. Following Omen's initial release, Victory Records released limited edition vinyl pressings in three colors, all of which included an MP3 download card. Of the three colors offered, only 600 red, 300 green, and 100 "clear with black smoke" were pressed. On October 11, 2011, the band released a music video for the song "Controller". The video featured scenes of the band performing the song and performing a Reservoir Dogs-inspired getaway scene == Background == Beginning on March 2, 2011, Victory Records posted a series of videos to their YouTube channel following the band through pre-production of their new EP, which would become Omen. On the band's choice to cover Metallica's "Fight Fire with Fire", Cocchi stated: > Of course, Metallica was up there on the list, and after spending some time > going through their discography we thought "Fight Fire With Fire" would suit > us best. It's a fun song, fast as fuck, and a bit challenging. It's also not > as popular as a lot of their other songs. We wanted to choose a Metallica > song that no one's really done before. On the band's choice to cover Kansas' "Carry On Wayward Son", Cocchi stated: > I don't think it's something that anyone would expect us to do, which is why > we chose it. We spent a good amount of time arranging the song and > attempting to add some new elements to it without completely "butchering" > it. It's definitely going to be a challenge for us, but that's the point > after all. == Reception == HeavyBlogIsHeavy writer Jimmy Rowe gave the EP a 4/5, calling "Controller" and "Infamy" his favorite two Within the Ruins songs to date. Conversely, he found the Kansas cover out of place following the two "insane tracks"that preceded it. He stated: > Even though the two covers (which are half of the EP) are quite lackluster, > the two new songs are the best two songs the band has written, so this EP is > definitely worth a listen, just treat this like a 2-track EP. If anything, > it made me look forward to their next release, which is bound to be amazing. == Track listing == == Personnel == ;Within the Ruins * Tim Goergen - vocals * Joe Cocchi - guitars * Jay Van Schelt - guitars * Mike Beaujean - bass * Kevin "Drummer" McGuill - drums == References == Category:2011 EPs Category:Within the Ruins albums Category:Victory Records EPs
