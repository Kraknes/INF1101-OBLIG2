Southern Naval Base () was a naval base of the Armed Forces of Ukraine located in a town of Novoozerne (part of Yevpatoria city) at the Donuzlav Bay, western part of Crimea. The base was reorganized in place of the Crimea Naval Base of the Soviet Union which completely was occupying the southern shores of Donuzlav Bay and included hovercraft berths, Donuzlav Air Station, and submarine base. Most of the former base is disassembled, while the former Donuzlav Air Station is non-operational. Donuzlav Bay is separated from the Black Sea by two sandspits which serve as a small freight port of the Yevpatoriya Commercial Trade Port located in the city. ==Base History== The naval base was established by Ukraine in 1996, and celebrated its 15th anniversary in 2011.Members of the Southern Naval Base of Ukrainian Navy celebrated 15th anniversary of establishing of Ukrainian Navy Members of the Southern Naval Base of Ukrainian Navy celebrated 15th anniversary of establishing of Ukrainian Navy ==2014 Ukraine Crisis related incidents== In connection with the events of social and political instability that led the Ukraine government to resignation on 28 January 2014, Russian parliament authorized the deployment of Russian military troops on Ukrainian soil with the official mandate of protection for Russian native population living in Crimea.
