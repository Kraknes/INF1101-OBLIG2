Roche Meane is a two-summit peak in the Massif des Ecrins in the French Alps. It is located on the crest between Barre des Ecrins () and La Meije (). The west summit is high and is called Pic Maitre; it is on the border between the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region of the departement of Hautes-Alpes and the Rhone-Alpes region of the departement of Isere. The east summit is high and is entirely within Hautes-Alpes. The two summits are located in the small massif of La Grande Ruine, the highest summit of which is that of Pointe Brevoort (), which is next to Roche Meane. Below the summits are rocky cliffs and three glaciers: the Clot des Cavales, the Grande Ruine glacier, and the Superieur des Agneaux. In 1907 Baedeker described the mountain as a "very difficult" two-and-a-half-hour ascent from this last.Southern France including Corsica: handbook for travellers, 5th ed.

The Societe des touristes du Dauphine maintains a travellers' refuge on the crest, reached in four and a half hours from Alpe de Villar d'Arene.Kev Reynolds, Ecrins National Park (French Alps): A Walking Guide, 2nd ed.
