During week two, Potter sang "This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)", gaining mixed reviews; Demi said "You're so energetic and you bring so much to the stage." but Simon Cowell disliked it.

Potter sang "Anyway" by Martina McBride. During week 3, Potter sang "Alone" by Heart, gaining positive reviews. Potter fell to the bottom two alongside Khaya Cohen, where she was eliminated after only Rowland voted against Cohen.
