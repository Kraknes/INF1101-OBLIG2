He was convicted and jailed in Richmond, Virginia, for preaching to British soldiers. He was threatened with being shot if he persisted. Zachariah was seven when his family moved to Bourbon County, Kentucky. This was during the time Boonesborough and Bryant's Station were established. In 1792 Augustine participated in a committee that was in charge of enabling Kentucky to separate from Virginia. Augustine and his other committee members, James Garrard and Ambrose Dudley, reported to the Elkhorn Baptist Association in favor of forbidding slavery in the Kentucky Constitution under development for the new state. Slavery was the major issue discussed at the 1792 drafting convention. Zachariah's sons, Henry J. Eastin, Robert Eastin, Thomas Eastin, and William A. Eastin all became civil engineers. Henry J Eastin was one of the first engineers to be employed by the State of Kentucky during the period of internal improvements.
