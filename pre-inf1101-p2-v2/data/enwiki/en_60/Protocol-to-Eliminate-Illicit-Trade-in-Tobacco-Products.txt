The Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products is a 2012 World Health Organization treaty designed to combat the worldwide illicit tobacco trade. The Protocol is supplementary to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The Protocol was concluded on 12 November 2012 in Seoul at the fifth session of the Conference of the Parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. It was opened for signature on 10 January 2013 and remained so until 9 January 2014. It was signed by 54 states and as September 2018 has been ratified by or acceded to by 58 parties. The Protocol entered into force on 25 September 2018 after being ratified by its 40th state. Only parties that have ratified the Framework Convention may ratify the Protocol. The Protocol contains provisions which require a ratifying state to take a variety of measures regarding the tobacco trade, including licensing; tracking and tracing; record-keeping; monitoring and regulating sales by Internet; international transit; and duty-free sales. The Protocol also promotes international co-operation in information sharing, mutual legal assistance, and extradition of persons suspected of involvement in the illicit tobacco trade. Once it has entered into force, the Protocol will be monitored by the Meeting of the Parties which convenes every other year immediately following the FCTC Conference of the parties. ==External links== *Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, WHO information page *Text *Signatures and ratifications Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products Category:Treaties concluded in 2012 Category:Treaties entered into force in 2018 Category:Treaties of Austria Category:Treaties of Benin Category:Treaties of Brazil Category:Treaties of Burkina Faso Category:Treaties of Chad Category:Treaties of the Comoros Category:Treaties of the Republic of the Congo Category:Treaties of Costa Rica Category:Treaties of Cyprus Category:Treaties of Ecuador Category:Treaties entered into by the European Union Category:Treaties of France Category:Treaties of Gabon Category:Treaties of the Gambia Category:Treaties of Germany Category:Treaties of Guinea Category:Treaties of India Category:Treaties of Iran Category:Treaties of Iraq Category:Treaties of Ivory Coast Category:Treaties of Latvia Category:Treaties of Lithuania Category:Treaties of Madagascar Category:Treaties of Mali Category:Treaties of Malta Category:Treaties of Mauritius Category:Treaties of Mongolia Category:Treaties of Nicaragua Category:Treaties of Niger Category:Treaties of Pakistan Category:Treaties of Panama Category:Treaties of Portugal Category:Treaties of Qatar Category:Treaties of Samoa Category:Treaties of Saudi Arabia Category:Treaties of Senegal Category:Treaties of Serbia Category:Treaties of Slovakia Category:Treaties of Spain Category:Treaties of Sri Lanka Category:Treaties of Eswatini Category:Treaties of Togo Category:Treaties of Turkey Category:Treaties of Turkmenistan Category:Treaties of the United Kingdom Category:Treaties of Uruguay Category:World Health Organization treaties
