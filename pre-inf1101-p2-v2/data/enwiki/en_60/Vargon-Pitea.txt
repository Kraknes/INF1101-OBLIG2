Vargon is an island in the northwest of the Swedish sector of the Bay of Bothnia, in the Pitea archipelago. ==Location== Vargon lies in the inner archipelago of Pitea. Since 1977 it has been designated a nature reserve. Camping is allowed, and visitors may fish and hunt, pick berries and mushrooms, make fires in designated areas and camp. An old fisherman's cottage may be used for overnight stays. In the winter, when the ice is at least thick, marked snowmobile trails are set from Svartnasudden (Bredanget) out to Mellerston, about , then to Vargon, about . The island is mainly covered with coniferous forests, but has open sandy areas. Pines grow near the shore and there are thinner old pine forests farther inland. The forests are rich in plant species. The island also holds wetlands and different shore environments. Raptors that have been seen nesting on the island included osprey, goshawk and hawk. The island has been considered as a site for wind power generation, as have Ranon in Kalix, Baggen in Pitea and Stor-Brandon in Lulea. However a 2009 report concluded that construction could not be justified given the relatively small potential capacity, the cost and environmental damage. ==References== Sources * * * * Category:Swedish islands in the Baltic Category:Islands of Norrbotten County
