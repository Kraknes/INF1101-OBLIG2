The Sagan ritual is performed by both Hindu and Buddhist Newars. ==Ceremony== As per the general practice, the person receiving the Sagan sits cross-legged on the floor, and a Sukunda oil lamp is placed on a large leaf in front and to the right. The eldest woman in the house brings a tray containing flowers, rice and red paste and worships Lord Ganesh, the god of good fortune, on the Sukunda. She then puts a dab of red paste on the forehead of the honoree and others in the room. The participants also take a dab of yogurt from a bowl and put it on the temple. The main ritual is performed next. The lady of the house presents a boiled egg and smoked fish which the participants accept with both hands. A woman helper follows pouring rice wine from a jar into little bowls. After everyone has been served, she walks down the line again pouring wine three times into each bowl. She serves wine a third time after which the participants can set down the bowls. The procedure and materials may vary as per family tradition and geography. Laddu (sweet balls) or Lagwah (meat balls) may be presented in place of boiled eggs. Seating may be arranged on the floor or chairs ==Significance== The Sagan ceremony and the materials used are based on Tantric tradition. The five food items in Sagan represent the five Tantric elements (panchatatwa) - fire or "agni tatwa" (symbolized by wine), earth or "prithvi tatwa" (meat), water or "jal tatwa" (fish), ether or "akash tatwa" (lentil cake) and air or "wayu tatwa" (egg). The warmth and fire in living beings is provided by fire, and when a being dies, the body becomes the earth, the body contains water, breathe air and exist in ether or space. ==See Also== *Prasada * Alcohol in Nepal ==References== Category:Rituals Category:Nepalese culture Category:Ceremonies Category:Tantric practices Category:Newar
