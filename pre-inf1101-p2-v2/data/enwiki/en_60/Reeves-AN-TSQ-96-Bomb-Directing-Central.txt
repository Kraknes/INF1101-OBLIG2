The Reeves AN/TSQ-96 Bomb Directing Central was a Cold War automatic tracking radar/computer/communications system ("Q" system). == Description == The AN/TSQ-96 operated in India Band monopulse variant of the conical scan Reeves AN/MSQ-77 Bomb Directing Central and had a solid state Univac 1219B computer with punch tape reader (Mark 152 fire control computer), http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jim-gurney/29/877/9b0 for ballistic calculation. As with the MSQ-77, an analog vacuum tube computer converted radar range, azimuth, and elevation to cartesian coordinates, but the TSQ-96 used a digital radiometer for analog-to-digital conversion. The TSQ-96 systems manufactured by Reeves Instrument Corporation were replaced by the US Dynamics AN/TPQ-43 Radar Bomb Scoring Set ("Seek Score"). ==Sites== An AN/TSQ-96 was used for Vietnam War ground-directed bombing training at Bergstrom AFB in Austin TX and tracked flights at the Matagorda Island General Bombing and Gunnery Range.http://testvector.com/Various.html Deployment of the central began at operating location 23 (OL-23) on Nakhon Phanom RTAFB during the Vietnam War"Nakhon Phanom had both an AN/MSQ-81 and an AN/TSQ-96." "OL-23 was the TSQ-96 system while OL-27 was the TSQ-81" and in 1983, Radar Bomb Scoring Division Detachment 24 operated a TSQ-96 for Radar Bomb Scoring in Guam.http://home.rmci.net/cbburke/charlie's/Charliesmilitarymemories.html The La Junta Bomb Plot also used a TSQ-96. This radar was the one at Keesler AFB and previously Bergstrom AFB. The set was packed up at Keesler AFB by personnel from Det. 8 and shipped to Det 1. Detachment 12, 1CEVG Hawthorne, Nevada had a TSQ-96 that had been transferred from Detachment 6, 1CEVG Bayshore, Michigan. Detachment 8, 1CEVG Richmond Ky from 1975 to 1982 then this system was transferred to Det. 24 Guam. ==References== Category:1965 establishments in New York (state) Category:1965 in military history Category:1990 in military history Category:1990 disestablishments in the United States Category:Aerial warfare ground equipment Category:Cold War military computer systems of the United States Category:Ballistics Category:Ground radars Category:Military equipment of the Vietnam War Category:Radars of the United States Air Force Category:Austin-Bergstrom International Airport
