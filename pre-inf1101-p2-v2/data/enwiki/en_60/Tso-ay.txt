Tso-ay, also known as Panayotishn or Pe-nel-tishn, today widely known by his nickname as "Peaches", (c. 1853 - December 16, 1933) was a Chiricahua, Western Apache warrior, who also served as a scout for General George Crook during the Apache wars. Tso-ay was wounded while fighting alongside Geronimo and Chihuahua against Mexican troops, who had ambushed them after the Apache had crossed the border while being pursued by American troops. ==Early life== Before serving as a scout for the army, Tso-ay rode with Chatto in a raid. The raid consisted of twenty six men and they traveled 400 miles. They covered between seventy five and one hundred miles a day and killed twenty six settlers. During the raid, Tso-ay, deciding he had had enough of raiding, left the war party to return to the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation. Following this Tso-ay was captured by Lieutenant Britton Davis who was accompanied by thirty scouts and some Tonto Apache. Davis sent a telegram to Crook notifying him of the capture of Tso-ay, and Crook requested that Davis enlist Tso-ay as a scout, if Tso-ay was willing. Tso-ay joined and was sent to meet with Crook at Willcox, where he was given the nickname "Peaches", because of his fair complexion and the smoothness of his skin. Tso-ay led Crook and his men into the upper Rio Bavispe and brought them to the camps of Chato and Benito. Tso- Ay was one of Crook's primary scouts and played a major role in leading the army into several of the strongholds the Apache had in Mexico. Although Tso-ay had served loyally he was exiled with Geronimo to Florida following the Apache wars. He retired in Cibecue and shortly before his death in 1933 he converted to Christianity. ==Legacy== Tso-Ay has been mentioned in Valdez is Coming, a western novel by Elmore Leonard. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * * * Category:Apache people Category:Chiricahua Category:United States Army Indian Scouts Category:1933 deaths
