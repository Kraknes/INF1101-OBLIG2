Orostachys spinosa Orostachys is a genus of the succulent family Crassulaceae (stonecrop family) that contains about 15 species. It is a biennial herb growing in China, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Mongolia, Russia. Eight species occur in China. ==Description== Orostachys are the most morphologically distinct member of subfamily Sempervivoideae, characterised by a semi-rosette habit, and spadix-like terminal, narrowly pyramidal to cylindrical inflorescence. leaves are linear to ovate, often with dull purple dots. The stem arrangement is alternate, forming a crowded cauline rosette. The roots are fibrous and it has no rhizome. The flowering stem is solitary, arising from the center of the rosette in the second year.} ==Taxonomy== Within family Crassulaceae, Orostachys is placed in tribe Telephieae of subfamily Sempervivoideae. The genus has. at times, included Meterostachys. Molecular phylogenetics shows that the genus is not monophyletic, but polyphyletic relative to paraphyletic Hylotelephium. Its circumscription, therefore, is unstable and subject to revision. ===Subdivision=== The genus Orostachys has been divided into series (or sections), including: * Orostachys series Appendiculatae * Orostachys series Eappendiculatae Other authors have created two different sections: * Orostachys section Orostachys * Orostachys section Schoenlandia Some species were transferred from Sinocrassula into Orostachys, as section Schoenlandia, also treated as a subgenus or section,,, or a separate genus Kungia, e.g. O. schoenlandii (Kungia schoenlandii). Orostachys section Orostachys, in turn has been treated as two subsections, differing by either flat or fleshy leaf shape, and the presence or absence of appendages on the leaves, which include spines or cartilaginous protrusions: * Orostachys subsection Orostachys * Orostachys subsection Appendiculatae On the basis of molecular data, it has been proposed that Orostachys subsection Appendiculatae be considered a separate genus. ====Species==== The genus includes about 12-17 accepted species, including: * Orostachys aggregata (Makino) H. Hara * Orostachys boehmeri V.N. Boriss. - also called O. furusei, endemic plant from Japan *Orostachys cartilaginea (H. Lev.) A. Berger * Orostachys chanetii A. Berger * Orostachys fimbriata (Turcz.) A.Berger * Orostachys genkaiensis Ohwi * Orostachys iwarenge Hara - Chinese Dunce Cap * Orostachys malacophylla (Pall.) Fisch. - type species * Orostachys minuta (Kom.) A. Berger * Orostachys paradoxa (Khokhr. & Vorosch.) Czerep. * Orostachys sikokiana (Makino) Ohwi * Orostachys spinosa (L.) Sweet * Orostachys thyrsiflora Fisch. ==References== ==Bibliography== * (full text at Research Gate) * * * * * , in Flora of China online vol. 8 Category:Crassulaceae Category:Crassulaceae genera
