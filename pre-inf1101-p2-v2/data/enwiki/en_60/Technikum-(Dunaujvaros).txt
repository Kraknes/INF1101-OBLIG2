A tree in Technikum Drinking water were ensured from Dunafoldvar and Budapest during the construction works. Decision about the construction is from November 1952. It has similar structure as Dunasor. Works were suspended in 1954, and the planned buildings with socreal facades were not built, because Khrushchev did not support this kind of art. Family residential houses were built with gardens in front of them, and there were avant-corps and arcades on them. These were built with reinforced concrete, with a main wall at the centre from brick. There were numerous designers, for example Jozsef Malomsoky, Zoltan Czellecz, Adam Solta, Ildiko Csaszar, Kalman Meszaros, Jozsef Tiefenbeck, Tamas Szubi, Gabor Rombauer. Jozsef Malomsoky gained the rights to plan the western part of Dunaujvaros with one of his plans from 1956. Two schools were built, one with 16, and another one with 20 rooms. Plans about the College of Dunaujvaros's predecessor are from 1952. The main idea was to make a technicum, a dormitory and a workshop, the latter being ready in 1956. ==Sources== * Dunaujvarosi Kozteri Szobrai, Varnai Gyula - Gyongyossy Csaba, 1999, Ma Kiado, * Dunapentele Sztalinvaros, Dunaujvaros Numizmatikai Emlekei 1950-2010, Asztalos Andrasne, ==External links== * Dunaujvaros Dunasor Category:Dunaujvaros
