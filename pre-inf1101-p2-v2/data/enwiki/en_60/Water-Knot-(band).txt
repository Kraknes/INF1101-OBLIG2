Water Knot is an alternative rock group from London, United Kingdom formed in 2011. The band consists of Austin Sage (lead vocals, lead guitar), Ian Post (keyboards), Joshua Stevenson (Bass), and James Atkinson (Drums). Water Knot have recorded a self-produced EP called Sometimes, which was released in 2013 digital only. The lead single "Lust", included on Sometimes, was featured in the action-thriller film Homefront by Sylvester Stallone in 2013. ==History== Water Knot first started playing in 2011 in the New York neighborhood Williamsburg, Brooklyn, well known for being an influential hub for indie rock, hipster culture, and the local art community. According to an interview by The Deli Magazine, the band was named "Water Knot" by its lead singer Austin after he had a dream where Bruce Lee was hitting a bucket full of water and the splash from the hit created a figure on the adjacent wall spelled "Water Knot." In 2012, the band gave their first concerts at the Bonnaroo Music Festival and at Reeperbahn Festival in Hamburg, Germany. American Songwriter said about Water Knot: "The New York quartet brought high energy to its set, which combined a Floydian space rock sound with eerie, ripping guitar solos" and "...I'm glad I stumbled upon Water Knot." As of 2015 Water Knot is based in London, UK. ==Discography== *Sometimes EP (2013) # Big Brother # Sometimes # Ready # Revelations # Lust ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Musical groups from London Category:Musical groups from Brooklyn Category:Musical groups established in 2011 Category:British alternative rock groups Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people
