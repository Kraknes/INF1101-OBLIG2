Vivianus (also Bibianus; died c. 490) was an early saint of the French (Francian) church and the first known bishop of Saintes. A brief Life of his dated to the mid 6th century was edited by Krush in 1896.MGH, SRM 3 (1896), 94-100. Krusch thought the text dated to the Carloingina period, but it is now typically dated to about the same time as Gregory's Glory of the Confessors, see Raymond Van Dam (ed., trans.), Volume 4 of Latin series, Translated Texts for Historians Series, Liverpool University Press, 1988, p. 42, fn. 63. He is also mentioned by Gregory of Tours later in the 6th century, who refers to the earlier text, saying "a book that has already been written about his life narrates the bulk of his miracles". ==References== Category:Merovingian saints Category:Bishops of Saintes Category:490 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown
