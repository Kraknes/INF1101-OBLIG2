And it served as a useful reminder of just how much we rely on electricity." The Independent's Tom Sutcliffe said "everything from presentational style to the level of the material it contains it's essentially a children's programme. In fact, it calls for a new verb: to Bluepeterise, a shorthand for the increasingly fashionable technique of dividing the content up between three puppyishly eager presenters". Lucy Mangan, writing for The Guardian called it "terrible". ==DVD release== The series was released in the original English as a region 2 DVD set by a Dutch company in 2015. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2013 British television series debuts Category:2013 British television series endings Category:2010s British documentary television series Category:BBC television documentaries Category:BBC high definition shows Category:2010s British television miniseries Category:Documentary television series about technology Category:English- language television shows Category:Works about the history of photography
