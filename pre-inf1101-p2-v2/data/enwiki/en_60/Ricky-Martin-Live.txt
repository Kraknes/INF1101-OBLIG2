In late May 2013, it was announced that he will tour Australia in October 2013, for the first time in over ten years. Martin will promote his already Gold-certified Greatest Hits: Souvenir Edition compilation and his new top-ten single "Come with Me". After originally announcing five concerts, four more dates were added later, including second concerts in Sydney Super Dome and Rod Laver Arena. ==Critical response== The Australian leg has received positive reviews from music critics. Helen Gregory from The Newcastle Herald wrote that Martin has delivered one of Newcastle's biggest shows of the year, fulfilling his promise to have the audience "sweating, dancing and shaking their bon bons in a night of intense adrenalin." This was Martin at his best; "energetic, engaging, charming and still at the helm of a powerhouse voice, even when swivelling his hips and samba dancing his way through a 95 minute set." The show was a great production, complete with lights, video, ten full or partial costume changes, eight dancers and a band composed of musicians from all over the world. Reviews by Take 40 Australia, Ninemsn and Glam Adelaide were also enthusiastic. ==Opening act== *Timomatic (select dates) *DJ Kid Massive (Sydney-October 18) ==Setlist== The following setlist was performed at the Allphones Arena, in Sydney, Australia on October 18, 2013.
