Santali cinema has its presence in the states of Jharkhand, West Bengal, Assam, Orissa, parts of Nepal, Jhapa District, and Morang District, where Santals live. Santali films are made in the Santali language. ==History== Although some initiatives have been taken to support Santali cinema, allowing it to prosper, only three films to date have managed to make it to the big screen . Chando Likhon which was released in 2001, was the first film to be made on 35 mm; second in this series was Sagun Ena Sohag Dular (2003), the story of which was loosely on the 1982 Bollywood film Nadiya Ke Paar. Jewee Jurie (Life Partner) (2009), produced by SBT Movie Craft was released widely in the states of Jharkhand, Odisha and other states. ==Overview== Santali cinema has not been able to create an identity as a film industry like most other cinemas in India. Every year about 8 to 10 films are made and released directly, on CDs only. None of them are released in cinema halls, due to low budget and least support of state government in development of the cinema. Music albums are preferred over video films, as the budget is very low and production cost is easily recovered. The number of these ranges from 10 to 20. Santali cinema has a good scope in the states of Jharkhand, West Bengal, Assam and Odisha the majority of its viewers reside in these regions. ==Present status== As there is no film development corporation in Jharkhand, the Santali film industry is in an unremarkable position, and due to this, films and music albums are made less in number and distributed inefficiently, due to cost and other reasons. Jharkhand, Dhanbad, Jamshedpur and their surroundings, don't have proper cinema halls and ticket prices are very low compared to multiplexes all over India. So releasing a film in cinema halls is not very profitable. ==Notable Santali films== *Sondhayni(2019) Director-Seral Murmu *Raawah(2017) Director-Seral Murmu * Chando Likhon The Script Of God)(2001) - first film to be made on 35 mm * Hai Re Aree Chali (Alas!
