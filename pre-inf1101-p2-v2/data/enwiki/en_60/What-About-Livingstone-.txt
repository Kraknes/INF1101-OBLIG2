"What About Livingstone?" is a song by ABBA, released on their 1974 album Waterloo. ==Synopsis== The Guardian article Abba, The Complete Studio Recordings described it as a song that "admonished Swedish youth for their disinterest in great explorers". ==Composition== The vocals are provided by Agnetha and Frida. The song has a "catchy bass synth riff" in the chorus. An "innovative vocal countermelody" in these choruses marks the start of a "steady rise in complexity when it came to vocal arrangements". ==Critical reception== The Guardian said the song had "weird lyrics". The Telegraph seems baffled that such a song exists, commenting "believe it or not, there's an Abba song called What About Livingstone?". Bright Lights Dark Shadows: The Real Story of Abba says both songs "get by on their whimsical charm". Abba - Uncensored on the Record suggests What About Livingston? and King Kong Song were novelty songs. It said What About Livingston? was "catchy" and "nice", though adds that there is nothing special about it. ==References== Category:ABBA songs Category:1974 songs Category:Songs written by Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus Category:Novelty songs Category:Songs about explorers Category:Cultural depictions of David Livingstone
