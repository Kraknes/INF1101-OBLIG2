The Unlikely Candidates are an American indie rock band. They formed in a suburb of Fort Worth, Texas in 2008. The band consists of lead vocalist Kyle Morris, lead guitarist Brenton Carney, guitarist Cole Male, drummer Kevin Goddard, and bassist Jared Hornbeek. Their song "Novocaine" topped the Alternative Songs chart and has received over 23 million streams and video views as of October 13th, 2020. They were signed with Atlantic Records as of 2013, but switched to the much smaller record label Another Century in October 2016. ==Career== After uniting in high school, the band immediately separated themselves from the typical musical traditions associated with Texas, and turned up with an alternative style of their own. In 2013, they released their debut EP Follow My Feet, and since then have released two more extended plays Bed of Liars in 2017, and Danger to Myself in 2017. The band has logged countless miles on the road alongside acts such as Young The Giant, The Dirty Heads, Fall Out Boy, and Brick & Morter. Their hit single "Oh My Dear Lord" (Danger to Myself EP) released in 2017 has over 13 million worldwide streams, and "Your Love Could Start a War" (Bed of Liars EP) released in 2017 has over 15 million worldwide streams. In 2019, they released the single and video for "Novocaine", which quickly gained popularity. A year later on April 16th, 2020, during the COVID-19 Pandemic, they released song called "Invincible." On May 29, 2020, the band released a new single titled "High Low". Frontman Kyle Morris said the song "is about isolation, loneliness, and longing for human connection". They released the music video for the song on October 7th, 2020. The band plan to release their first full-length album in January 2021. ==Discography== ===Extended plays=== * Follow My Feet (2013) * Bed of Liars (2017) * Danger to Myself (2017) ===Singles=== ====As lead artist==== {| class="wikitable plainrowheaders" style="text-align:center;" |- ! scope="col" rowspan="2" style="width:15em;"| Title ! scope="col" rowspan="2"| Year ! scope="col" colspan="4"| Peak chart positions ! scope="col" rowspan="2"| Album |- ! scope="col" style="width:2.5em;font-size:85%;" | US AAA ! scope="col" style="width:2.5em;font-size:85%;" | US Alt. * ! scope="col" style="width:2.5em;font-size:85%;" | US Rock ! scope="col" style="width:3em;font-size:85%;"| CAN Rock |- ! scope="row"|"Follow My Feet" | 2013 | 6 | 35 | -- | -- | Follow My Feet EP |- ! scope="row"|"Your Love Could Start a War" | rowspan="2"| 2016 | -- | 36 | -- | -- | rowspan="2"| Bed of Liars EP |- ! scope="row"|"Ringer" | -- | 38 | -- | -- |- ! scope="row"|"Oh My Dear Lord" | 2018 | -- | -- | -- | -- | Danger to Myself EP |- ! scope="row"|"Novocaine" | 2019 | 37 | 1 | 5 | 23 | |- ! scope="row"|"High Low" | 2020 | -- | 19 | -- | -- | |- | colspan="8" style="font- size:85%"| "--" denotes a single that did not chart or was not released in that territory. |} ====As featured artist==== {| class="wikitable plainrowheaders" style="text-align:center;" |- ! scope="col" rowspan="2" style="width:15em;"| Title ! scope="col" rowspan="2"| Year ! scope="col" colspan="2"| Peak chart positions ! scope="col" rowspan="2"| Album |- ! scope="col" style="width:2.5em;font-size:85%;" | US Alt. ! scope="col" style="width:2.5em;font-size:85%;" | US Rock |- ! scope="row"|"Celebrate" (Dirty Heads featuring The Unlikely Candidates) | 2017 | 12 | 31 | Swim Team |- | colspan="8" style="font-size:85%"| "--" denotes a single that did not chart or was not released in that territory. |} ====Notes==== ==References== Category:Indie rock musical groups from Texas Category:Musical groups established in 2008 Category:2008 establishments in Texas Category:Another Century Records artists
