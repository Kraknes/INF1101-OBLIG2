Pandinotoxins are toxins from the venom of the emperor scorpion Pandinus imperator. They are selective blockers of voltage-gated potassium channels ==Sources== The source for the pandinotoxins is the venom of the scorpion Pandinus imperator. ==Chemistry== ===Family=== The toxins of the family are designated pandinotoxin (PiTX)-Ka, PiTX-Kb, and PiTX-Kg They are members of the a-KTx family of scorpion toxins. ===Structure and homology=== {| style="float: right; clear: right; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em; background: #ffffff;" class="toccolours" border="0" cellpadding="1" align="right" width="350" !The sequences of Pandinotoxins |- | bgcolor="#eeeeee" | CTX :ZFTNVSCTTSKE-CWSVCQRLHNTSR-GKCMNKKCRCYS PiTXK- a :\---TISCTNPKQ- CYPHCKKETGYPN-AKCMNRKCKCFGR PiTXK- b :\---TISCTNEKQ-CYPHCKKETGYPN- AKCMNRKCKCFGR PiTX-K g :\---LVKCRGTSD-CGRPCQQQTGCPN-SKCINRMCKCYGC Figure 1: Sequence of Pandinotoxins. Adapted from Solution Structure for Pandinus Toxin K-R (PiTX-KR) |} ====Pandinotoxin Ka and -b==== The amino acid sequences of PiTX-K a and PiTX-K b are identical, except for the seventh amino acid: a proline in PiTX-Ka and a glutamic acid in PiTX-Kb (see Fig.1). PiTX-Ka and PiTX-Kb are 35-residue peptides, which are found to have an a-helix from residues 10 to 21 and two b-sheets (b 1 is from residues 26-28, b 2 is from residues 33-35). One face of the a-helix is anchored to the b-sheet by three disulfide bonds which are conserved in all members of the charybdotoxin family (R-K toxins). PiTX-K a and PiTX-K b have only two b-sheets whereas other members of the family have three additional amino acid residues at the N-terminal portion, which forms a third b-sheet. ====Pandinotoxin Kg==== Pandinotoxin Kg has not yet been investigated. ==Target== Pandinotoxins are the most potent inhibitors of the rapidly inactivating A-type voltage-gated potassium channels. They also block the delayed rectifier, slowly inactivating channels of the subfamily A member 2 (Kv1.2/KCNA2) [1] and they can reversibly block the shaker B potassium-channels (Kv1.1 sub-family). ==Mode of action== The residue K27, a lysine at place 27 of the protein sequence, interacts with the voltage sensitivity blocking activity of CTX channels. It is conserved among PiTX-K a and PiTX-K b. This amino acid is located nearby the selectivity filter of the pore and it is responsible for the interaction with A-type channels by being inserted in the pore of the ion channels. The structural differences in the backbone and side chain between PiTX-Ka and CTX result in a higher affinity for A-type channels for PiTX-Ka. The affinity for the Shaker B K+ channel is significantly smaller for PiTX-Kb in comparison with PiTX-Ka owing to the changes in the seventh residue. ==Therapeutic use== Intraplantarly injection of PiTX-Ka before or after the administration of diclofenac produces a significant reduction in spontaneous flinching, mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in a rat model for bone cancer. Downregulation of PiTX-Ka almost completely eliminates diclofenac-induced anti-nociception. ==References== Category:Neurotoxins Category:Ion channel toxins Category:Invertebrate toxins
