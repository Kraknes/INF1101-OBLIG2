The Thebes Courthouse in Thebes, Illinois, is the former county courthouse of Alexander County. Plans to build the courthouse began in 1845, when the county seat was moved to Thebes from Unity. Architect L. I. Lightner planned the courthouse, which he designed in a Southern Greek Revival style featuring a two-story porch and four front pillars. Contractor Ernstt Barkhausen built the courthouse for $4,400, and the building was completed in 1848. It served as Alexander County's courthouse until the county seat was moved to Cairo in 1860. The courthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 26, 1972. It now serves as the headquarters of the Thebes Historical Society. ==References== Category:Courthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Government buildings completed in 1848 Category:Buildings and structures in Alexander County, Illinois Category:County courthouses in Illinois Category:Greek Revival architecture in Illinois Category:Historical societies in Illinois Category:Former courthouses in Illinois Category:National Register of Historic Places in Alexander County, Illinois
