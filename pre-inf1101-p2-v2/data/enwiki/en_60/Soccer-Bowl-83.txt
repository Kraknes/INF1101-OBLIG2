Soccer Bowl '83 was the 17th edition of the Soccer Bowl, the championship match of North American Soccer League (NASL), which took place on October 1, 1983. It was the final match of the 1983 North American Soccer League playoffs and was contested by the Tulsa Roughnecks and the Toronto Blizzard at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia. ==Background== The Tulsa Roughnecks won the Southern Division with a 17-13 record and a total of 145 points. They dispatched the Fort Lauderdale Strikers in the quarterfinals with a two-game sweep. By virtue of their two games to one victory In the semifinals against the Montreal Manic, the Roughnecks advanced to the Soccer Bowl for the first time in franchise history. The Toronto Blizzard qualified for the playoffs as a wild card by finishing third in the Eastern Division with a 16-14 record and a total of 135 points. In the quarterfinals they were the upset-winner over the Western Division champion Vancouver Whitecaps by two games to one. Vancouver had only lost 6 matches all season. The Blizzard pulled off a second upset in their semifinal match-up by sweeping the Golden Bay Earthquakes in two games, and earning their second ever trip to the Soccer Bowl. ===Pre-match controversy=== During game three of their semifinal series with Montreal, Tulsa forward Ron Futcher picked up his third yellow card of the playoffs. By rule this earned him a one-match suspension, and league director of operations Ted Howard was poised to enforce it. For his part, Futcher was not only the team's leading scorer, but also a leader in the Roughnecks' locker room. Tulsa's owners appealed the yellow card and even alluded to the press, the possibility of boycotting the final if Futcher was not allowed to play. Toronto team president Clive Toye felt that bending the rules for a star player might set a bad precedent, but was nevertheless prepared to face whatever lineup Tulsa put on the pitch. Ultimately, NASL president Howard J. Samuels overruled Ted Howard and decided to allow Futcher to play, because he felt that the fans in attendance would be the ones made to suffer by Futcher's absence. ==Game summary== ===Championship results=== {| width=92% |- | | |} {| style="width:100%;" |- | style="vertical-align:top; width:50%;"| {| style="font-size: 90%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" |colspan="4"| |- !width="25"| !!width="25"| |- |GK ||0 || Winston DuBose |- |D ||5|| Val Fernandes |- |D ||2|| Terry Moore |- |D ||18 || Victor Moreland (c) |- |D ||3 || Barry Wallace |- |M ||17|| Adam Krupa || || |- |M ||9|| Iraj Danaifard |- |M ||20 || Ivan Belfiore || || |- |F ||6|| Njego Pesa |- |F ||14 || Laurie Abrahams |- |F ||9|| Ron Futcher |- |colspan="4"|Substitutes: |- |GK ||22|| Paul Coffee |- |M ||11|| Thompson Usiyan || || |- |M ||4|| Pasquale Fuccillo || || |- |F ||7|| Zequinha |- |M ||10 || Gerry Reardon |- |M ||13 || Todd Saldana |- |colspan="4"|Manager: |- |colspan="4"| Terry Hennessey |} |valign="top"| | style="vertical-align:top; width:50%;"| {| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="font-size:90%; margin:auto;" |colspan="4"| |- !width="25"| !!width="25"| |- |GK ||1|| Jan Moller |- |D ||3|| Bruce Wilson (c)|| |- |D ||4|| Conny Karlsson |- |D ||17 || Derek Spalding || |- |D ||10 || Cliff Calvert |- |M ||16 || Randy Ragan |- |M ||8 || Patrick Ntsoelengoe |- |M ||5 || Jimmy Nicholl |- |F ||19|| David Byrne |- |F ||11 || Roberto Bettega |- |F ||6|| Neill Roberts || |- |colspan="4"|Substitutes: |- |GK ||22|| Sven Habermann |- |M ||14 || Geoff Wegerle || |- |D ||7 || Victor Kodelja |- |D ||24 || Collin Miller |- |M ||12 || Pasquale de Luca | || || || || |- |colspan="4"|Manager: |- |colspan="4"| Bob Houghton |} |} 1983 NASL Champions: Tulsa Roughnecks {| style="width:100%; font-size:90%;" |- | style="width:50%; vertical-align:top;"| Soccer Bowl MVP: Njego Pesa |} {| style="width:100%; font-size:90%;" |- | style="width:50%; vertical-align:top;"| Assistant referees: Howard Krollfeifer Gary Shugarts Fourth official: Bill Maxwell |} Television: Budwieser Network (syndicated) Announcers: Bob Carpenter, Gordon Bradley Touchline reporter: Al Miller ===Statistics=== {| class="wikitable plainrowheaders" style="text-align:center" |- !scope=col width=100 |Statistic !scope=col width=70 | Tulsa !scope=col width=70 | Toronto |- !scope=row|Goals scored | 2 | 0 |- !scope=row|Total shots | 11 | 14 |- !scope=row|Shots on target | 4 | 3 |- !scope=row|Saves | 3 | 2 |- !scope=row|Corner kicks | 2 | 5 |- !scope=row|Fouls | 19 | 19 |- !scope=row|Offsides | 4 | 9 |- !scope=row|Yellow cards | 0 | 2 |- !scope=row|Red cards | 0 | 0 |} == See also == * 1983 North American Soccer League season == References == ==External links== * NASL Soccer Bowl (official website) 1983 Category:1983 in Canadian soccer 1983 Category:Toronto Blizzard matches Category:Sport in Vancouver Category:1983 in British Columbia Category:Sports competitions in Vancouver
