He showed his design and received his first orders at the International Home and Housewares Show from retailers such as The Container Store and Bed, Bath & Beyond. The company was originally called Canworks due to its focus on trash cans, but Yang changed the name to simplehuman in 2001 when the company began to broaden its product line into other kitchen and bath tools, such as touch-free sensor pumps and shower caddies, under the tagline "Tools for Efficient Living". In 2003, simplehuman opened a UK subsidiary in Oxfordshire, England to serve the European market. Using sensor technology and the idea of touch-free operation, simplehuman introduced its first sensor soap pump in 2007. And in 2010, it came out with the first of its line of motion sensor-activated trash cans. In 2013, the company took this sensor technology into the beauty tools market with the introduction of its first sensor- activated vanity mirror that uses LED light technology. ==Products== simplehuman focuses on five main product lines: * Trash Cans & Liners * Sensor Pumps & Soap * Dishracks & other kitchen tools * Shower Caddies & other bath tools * Sensor Mirrors ==Awards== simplehuman's products and designs have won numerous prestigious awards including: * The Housewares Design Award in 2013 for the semi-round sensor can * The European Consumer Choice Awards in 2011 for the steel frame dishrack * The European Consumer Choice Awards in 2012 for the butterfly sensor can ==Partners== simplehuman's products are sold both on their website and at various retail stores such as: * The Container Store * Bed Bath & Beyond * Williams Sonoma * Crate & Barrel == References == ==External links== *Official website *UK website *Canadian website *French Canadian website *French website *German Website Category:Companies established in 2000 Category:Companies based in Torrance, California
