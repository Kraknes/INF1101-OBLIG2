One version talks of Igala influence, while another version point at Eri-Nri influence. More claims were that while there was Eri-Nri influences in the area, the influence of Attah of Igala was more felt in the early settlement of the inhabitants of Obimo town just like many other localities within Nsukka area. although, most of the inhabitants believe that they didn't migrate from anywhere, but as has always been there. this point they back up with, the fact that they do not share any social affiliation with any village, in terms of giving them respect as their Ancestors or somewhere they migrated from. Old Obimo inhabitants were believed to be great sculptors; traces of this can be seen in one of the smallest villages in Obimo, (Ama-eha Agbo). They can be dug up from the compound of a man popularly referred to as Ugwuta Alaya Onyechi, but whose real name is Abel Ugwoke. ==Socio-cultural== These communities were traditional religionists. They attach most of their socio-cultural, political, and economic activities to traditional African religion - until the advent of the white man with his new religion. ==Economy== They are subsistence agriculturalists depending more on their locally produced agricultural tools like hoes, axes and matchets. Their most staple food crop to present is yam (Dioscorea spp). They also engage in crafts and artistic works like blacksmithing, carving, basket making, weaving.
