This is a list of episodes from the fourth and final season of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis; the series' title was changed to Max Shulman's Dobie Gillis during this season. This season continues with the misadventures of Dobie Gillis and his best friend Maynard G. Krebs at Central City's S. Peter Pryor Junior College, Dobie continuing to deal with life with his parents, Herbert and Winifred Gillis, and working in (or trying not to work in) his father's grocery store. Two new recurring characters were added: Virgil Gillis, Herbert's dishonest would-be music star cousin from Tennessee, and Duncan "Dunky" Gillis, Dobie's cousin and Herbert's nephew, who comes to live with the Gillis family and becomes Maynard's running partner. Sheila James and William Schallert left Dobie Gillis before the start of the fourth season; Schallert to star in the pilot for Philbert and James to star in the pilot for a Dobie Gillis spinoff, Zelda. Both shows went unsold, and James returned to Dobie on a freelance basis for four episodes towards the end of this final season. ==Broadcast history== The season originally aired Wednesdays at 8:30-9:00 pm (EST) on CBS from September 26, 1962 to June 5, 1963, moving from its original Tuesday at 8:30pm slot.
