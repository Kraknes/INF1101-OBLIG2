Wilfried Elmenreich (born 1973 in Furstenfeld, Austria) is an Austrian researcher and professor of Smart Grids at the Alpen-Adria-Universitat Klagenfurt. == Biography == Wilfried Elmenreich studied computer science at the Vienna University of Technology where he received his master's degree in 1998. He became a research and teaching assistant at the Institute of Computer Engineering at Vienna University of Technology in 1999. He received his doctoral degree with distinction on the topic of time-triggered sensor fusion in 2002. From 1999 to 2007 he was the chief developer of the time-triggered fieldbus protocol TTP/A and the Smart Transducer Interface standard. In 2003, he started the international Workshop on Intelligent Solutions in Embedded Systems (WISES),1\.
