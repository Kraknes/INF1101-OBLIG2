Filmink said Steel "is the male lead for pirate queen Gianna Maria Canale, who beats him in a sword duel and has to rescue him later. Which is surprisingly and enjoyably feminist but presumably helped further dint Steel's already-fragile ego. Incidentally, the film indicates that the actor's physical appearance was starting to disintegrate - he was still handsome with all his hair and no gut, but his face was appearing increasingly gaunt and tired." ==References== ==External links== * *Tiger of the Seven Seas at TCMDB *Tiger of the Seven Seas at Letterbox DVD Category:1962 films Category:Italian films Category:1960s historical adventure films Category:Films directed by Luigi Capuano Category:Films scored by Carlo Rustichelli Category:Pirate films Category:Italian historical adventure films
