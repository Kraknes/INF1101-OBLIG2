Zlatni Prsti (Serbian Cyrillic: Zlatni Prsti, trans. Golden Fingers) was a Yugoslav rock band from Zajecar. In the late 1970s, the band changed their name to Nokaut (Serbian Cyrillic: Nokaut, trans. Knockout). ==Band history== ===1970 - 1981=== The band was formed in 1970 by Momcilo Radenkovic (guitar), Slobodan Radenkovic (bass guitar), Dragan Batalo (keyboards) and Dragan Trajkovic (drums). The band's first vocalist was Jovan Rasic. After he moved to Generacija 5, the singing duties were taken over by Momcilo Radenkovic. The band gained the public's attention after winning the first place at the Zajecar Gitarijada festival in 1974, after which they appeared on the various artists record published by Radio Belgrade show Vece uz radio (Evening by the Radio) with the song "Nasa pesma" ("Our Song").

In 1976, the band released their debut self-titled album through PGP-RTB. The recording of the album lasted only eighteen hours. Most of the songs on the album were composed by Momcilo Radenkovic, while the lyrics were written by lyricist Mirko Glisic. After the album was released, the band, dissatisfied with the deal they had with PGP-RTB, signed with Diskos, releasing a 7" single with the songs "Resih da se zenim" ("I Decided to Get Married") and "Posebna si uvek bila" ("You Were Always Special") through the label. After that, they signed for Jugoton, releasing their first hit through the label, "Igraj rege" ("Dance to Reggae") in 1977. In 1977, the band appeared on the double various artists live album Pop parada 1 (Pop Parade 1), recorded in Pinki Hall, with the songs "Pevajmo ljubavi" ("Lets Sing to Love") and "Posebna si uvek bila". During the same year, the band also appeared on the various artists album Brigadirska pesma (Brigadiers' Song), recorded for the needs of youth work actions, with the song "Ne mogu sam da budem brigada" ("I Can't Be a Brigade just by Myself"). During the same year, the band performed on the sixth BOOM Festival. In 1979, the band released their second studio album, entitled Nokaut!. Soon after the album was released, they decided to adopt Nokaut as their new name. With the new name came changes in the lineup: Batalo had to leave the band due to his army obligations, and was replaced by Dusan Maslac (a former member of the band Prava Stvar), and Slobodan Radenkovic left the band to dedicate himself to his pizzeria, and was replaced by Jovan Nikolc. At the beginning of the 1980s, at the time of the popularity of new wave bands, the band saw a decline of popularity. They tried to keep up with younger acts with new wave influenced songs published on 7" singles, but only their ballads saw some moderate success, mostly thanks to Momcilo Radenkovic's raspy voice. Soon after, the band ended their activity. ===Post-breakup=== In the late 1980s, Momcilo Radenkovic, Batalo and Trajkovic played on two albums by folk singer Boban Zdravkovic, Klinka (Little Girl, 1988) and Prastam ti, duso (I Forgive You, My Darling, 1989), and the albums were released under the Boban Zdravkovic & Zlatni Prsti.Zlatni Prsti at Discogs In 1999, Raglas Records released the compilation album Zlatna kolekcija (Golden Collection), for which some of the songs were rerecorded by Momcilo Radenkovic.
