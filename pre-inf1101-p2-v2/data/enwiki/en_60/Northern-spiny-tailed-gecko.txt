The northern spiny-tailed gecko (Strophurus ciliaris) is a species of lizard in the family Diplodactylidae. The species is endemic to Australia. ==Etymology== The meaning of the scientific name or binomial, Strophurus ciliaris, comes from strophurus meaning "turning-tail" and ciliaris meaning "eyelashed", referring to the spines above the eyes.Ehmann, Harald (1992). Encyclopedia of Australian Animals: Reptiles. Angus and Robertson. 495 pp. ==Description== S. ciliaris is highly variable in colour.Cogger HG (1996). Reptiles & Amphibians of Australia. Port Melbourne: Reed. This species can vary from a uniform grey colour, with few black or orange scales, to rich brown, with a mottled pattern of grey, white, and orange scales. Spines are present along the tail, and long spines are generally present above the eyes, giving the impression of being eye-lashed.Wilson S, Swan G (2008). A Complete Guide to Reptiles of Australia. Chatswood: New Holland Publishers. The average length for a member of this species is . Females are known to be significantly larger than males.How RA, Dell J, Wellington BD (1986). "Comparative Biology of Eight Species of Diplodactylus Gecko in Western Australia". Herpetologica 42 (4): 471-482. ==Reproduction== S. ciliaris an oviparous species that has a clutch size of two.Strophurus ciliaris at the Australian Reptile Online Database.

This is used as a deterrent for birds and other predations whilst they are perching in shrubs. Another defence mechanism that S. ciliaris has is bright palate colour.Michael D (2013, October). Strophurus ciliaris. (S. Van Den Akker, Interviewer). ==Behaviour and habitat== The northern spiny-tailed gecko is generally a nocturnal species but can be found basking during the day.Browne-Cooper, Robert; Bush, Brian; Maryan, Brad; Robinson, David (2007). Reptiles and Frogs in the Bush: Southwestern Australia. University of Western Australia Press. pp. 123, 124. . It is an arboreal species which occurs in arid, semi-arid, and subtropical habitats in shrubland.Cogger HG (2000). Reptiles and Amphibians of Australia. Sydney: New Holland Publishers.Swan G, Foster R (2005). "The reptiles and amphibians of Mutawintji National Park, Western New South Wales". Australian Zoologist 33 (1): 39-48. It can also be commonly found in clumps of spinifex.Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. (2013). Australian Faunal Directory. Retrieved from Species Strophurus ciliaris (Boulenger, 1885): http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/online- resources/fauna/afd/taxa/Strophurus_ciliaris ==Conservation status== S. ciliaris is currently listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. This is due to its large distribution, unrestricted habitat preferences, and the limited number of threats facing this species. ==Diet== Little is known about the diet of this S. ciliaris. However, similar to other members of the gecko families, its diet includes arthropods. It has been observed licking the exudes of wattle sap. ==Geographic range== The northern spiny-tailed gecko occurs in the interior of Australia, and its range extends from the northwest region of New South Wales and western Queensland through to South Australia and the Northern Territory, and then stretches into Western Australia.Horner P, Hutchinson M (2010). "Strophurus ciliaris ". IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2013.1. www.iucnredlist.org. Downloaded on 6 October 2013. Of the recorded occurrences of this species, 48 percent have been recorded in the Northern Territory, 31.2 percent in Western Australia, 10.9 percent in South Australia, and the remaining across New South Wales and Queensland. There have been no recorded occurrences of this species in Victoria.The Atlas of Living Australia. (2013). Strophurus ciliaris (Boulenger, 1885). Retrieved from http://bie.ala.org.au/species/Strophurus+ciliaris# ==Subspecies== S. ciliaris has one desert form and one tropical form. There are two subspecies, Strophurus ciliaris ciliaris and Strophurus ciliaris aberrans. ==Threats== Habitat degradation is a threat to the northern spiny-tailed gecko. A large amount of this species' habitat has been lost or heavily degraded by land clearing and feral invasive species including goats. Habitat degradation and loss should not be considered a major threat at this time due to the wide distribution and a large amount of suitable habitat that remains. ==References== ==Further reading== *Boulenger GA (1885).
