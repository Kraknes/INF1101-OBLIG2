By the late 1920s, under the United States' Insular Government, the road from Plaza Dilao to the Pasig River across from Santa Mesa was constructed which was later named Tomas Claudio Street (also Paco-Santa Mesa Road) after the Filipino World War I hero, Tomas Mateo Claudio. Following the Burnham Plan for Manila, the road was further extended south to meet Harrison Boulevard that ran southwest from Calle Herran (now Pedro Gil Street) up to Dewey Boulevard (now Roxas Boulevard). The whole length of the highway that forms part of Circumferential Road 2 was later named in honor of the sixth President of the Philippines, Elpidio Quirino. ==Landmarks== Manila Zoo Old Paco station on Quirino Avenue * Aloha Hotel * Asociacion de Damas de Filipinas * Bureau of Plant Industry * Jacinto Zamora Elementary School * Manila Zoological and Botanical Garden * Old Paco railway station * Ospital ng Maynila Medical Center * Malacanang Hospital * Manuel Roxas High School * Paraiso ng Batang Maynila Park * Philippine Columbian Association * Plaza Dilao * President Elpidio Quirino Monument * Saint Peter the Apostle School * San Andres Market * Zamora Market == Intersections == ===Quirino Avenue=== ===Quirino Avenue Extension=== == See also == *Major roads in Manila ==References== Category:Streets in Manila Category:Malate, Manila Category:Paco, Manila Category:Pandacan
