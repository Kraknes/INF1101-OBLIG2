Though a live performing band, electronic music production was part of their forte since their inception. The band did most of their own production work, recording and mixing, and two of its members had studied electronic music in college. The Remixes EP is a collection of their remix work from 2009-2010. The first track was made for a Scion A/V remix collection of Todd Edwards' "I Might Be". The second track was highly praised for its use of live instruments by Arjanwrites music blog. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from Bandcamp music store. * My Dear Disco - producer, performer on live instruments ==References== Category:2010 EPs Category:Ella Riot EPs Category:Remix EPs Category:2010 remix albums
