On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Michael Nordine from Slant Magazine rated the film one and a half out of four stars, calling the film "a jumbled mess that can't make its deliberate incoherence interesting". Dennis Harvey of Variety offered the film similar criticism, writing, "Reeder shows a knack for unsettling audiovisual textures, but once it's clear The Oregonian will offer no real storyline or explanations, viewer patience wears thin". The film was not without its supporters' David D'Arcy from Screen Daily commended the film's atmosphere, soundtrack, and Pulsipher's performance. David Fear of Time Out rated the film three out of five stars, writing, "though Reeder's attempts to unnerve sometimes veer close to enfant terrible posturing, The Oregonian knows how to work its unpleasantness to primo psychotronic effect". Eric Kohn from IndieWire awarded the film a score B+, writing, "Alternately creepy, puzzling and assaulting on the senses, at best The Oregonian functions as a nightmarish headtrip with ample doses of dark comedy". Kohn, however, criticized the film's third act, which he felt 'failed to put its compelling fragments together'. ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:2011 films Category:2010s avant-garde and experimental films Category:2011 horror films Category:American films Category:American avant-garde and experimental films Category:American horror films Category:American independent films Category:English-language films Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in California Category:Films shot in Washington (state) Category:Films set in Oregon Category:Kickstarter-funded films
