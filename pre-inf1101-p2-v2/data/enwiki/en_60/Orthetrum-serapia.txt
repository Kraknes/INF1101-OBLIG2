Orthetrum serapia, the green skimmer, is a freshwater dragonfly in the family Libellulidae. The serapia species is present in Australia, the Philippines, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands. It inhabits a wide range of still and sluggish waters, often shallow. In Australia it ranges from the top end of the Northern Territory to about Mackay in central Queensland. ==Description== Orthetrum serapia is a medium-sized dragonfly with a wingspan of 60-85mm. Its wings are clear except for a small dark spot at the base of the hindwing. The thorax is greenish to greyish yellow with black markings. The abdomen is black with pale yellow or pale green markings. Orthetrum serapia appears very similar to Orthetrum sabina and can be confused where the range of the two overlap in north-eastern Australia. ==Gallery== Green skimmer 7219.jpg|Male side view Green Skimmer 4846.Jpg|Male dorsal view Green Skimmer ventral forewing (17087429388).jpg|Female face Orthetrum serapia female wings (34928552071).jpg|Female wings Orthetrum serapia male wings (34928557561).jpg|Male wings ==See also== * List of Odonata species of Australia ==References== ==External links== Category:Libellulidae Category:Odonata of Australia Category:Odonata of Oceania Category:Insects of Australia Category:Insects of Fiji Category:Insects of Papua New Guinea Category:Insects of the Philippines Category:Insects of the Solomon Islands Category:Taxa named by J.A.L.
