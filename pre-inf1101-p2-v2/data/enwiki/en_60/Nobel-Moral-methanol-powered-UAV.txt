Nobel Moral methanol powered UAVs are Chinese UAVs developed by Shenyang Noble Moral Aviation (Noble Moral, Chen Yang Tong Fei Hang Kong Ke Ji You Xian Gong Si ), which originally had jointly developed several unmanned helicopters with Tianjin University and Shenyang Institute of Automation (SYIA, Chen Yang Zi Dong Hua Yan Jiu Suo ) of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Based on the experience gained from these projects, Nobel Moral has since developed numerous unmanned helicopters of its own. The general designer of these UAV are Mr. Liu Bin (Liu Bin ), who is also the founder of the company.general designer ==30 class RPV== 30 class RPV is an experimental UAV developed by Nobel Moral to test Chinese built remotely piloted vehicles (RPV). The entire program cost around Y= 1000000 and was completed in December 1997. At the time of its completion, it was the first remotely piloted unmanned helicopter indigenously developed by China. One of the main goal of this remotely piloted unmanned helicopter is to test domestic Chinese built fuselage, because previously, China lacked the capability to produce the fuselage and must import it from Japan with unit price tag of Y= 1600. The general designer spend Y= 80000 to invest in equipment and produced a domestic Chinese built fuselage which not only proved to be superior in quality in comparison to the imported one, but more importantly, much cheaper, with a unit cost of only Y= 50.1st Chinese RC helicopter Specification: *Length (m): 1.55 *Width (m): 0.55 *Height (m): 0.53 ==30 class survey UAV== 30 class survey UAV is an unmanned helicopter developed by Nobel Moral for aerial survey / photography applications. The fuselage is constructed of fiber glass, and it is powered by an OS32 class methanol engine. Specification: *Length (m): 1.55 *Width (m): 0.55 *Height (m): 0.65 ==50 class survey UAV== 50 class survey UAV is an unmanned helicopter developed by Nobel Moral for aerial survey / photography applications, and it is a development of earlier 30 class survey UAV. Like its smaller predecessor, the fuselage of 50 class survey UAV is also constructed of fiber glass, and it is powered by an OS46 class methanol engine. Specification: *Length (m): 1.55 *Width (m): 0.55 *Height (m): 0.75 ==AH-64 Apache drone== AH-64 Apache drone is an unmanned helicopter developed by Nobel Moral originally for airshows, but has been adopted by Chinese military for training of the air defense force. The drone is mainly used to provide realistic visual identification training of the ground force and air crews. AH-64 Apache drone is constructed of metal and powered by OS32 class methanol engine. Specification: *Length (m): 1.15 *Width (m): 0.8 *Height (m): 0.4 ==Aileron less UAV== Aileron less UAV is UAV is an experimental UAV developed by Nobel Moral, and it is an unmanned helicopter in coaxial layout with aileron eliminated. Aileron less UAV is a remotely piloted vehicle (RPV), and its development was completed in March 2009. Specification: *Length (m): 1.55 *Width (m): 0.55 *Height (m): 0.6 ==Communication relay UAV== Communication relay UAV (Tong-Xun Zhong-Ji-Yong Wu-Ren Zhi-Sheng-Ji, Tong Xun Zhong Ji Yong Wu Ren Zhi Sheng Ji ) is an unmanned helicopter developed by TJU in conventional layout and the landing gear consists of a pair of skids. This unmanned helicopter is intended to form an emergency communication network after disasters have destroyed the communication infrastructure. Design was completed in November 2004 and it has been in service since. When operating, a pair of communication relay UAV is needed, and both hovering at an altitude of 150 meter to provide emergency wireless communication for disaster relief. Specification:Communication relay UAV *Length (m): 2 *Width (m): 0.74 *Height (m): 0.6 ==EOD UAV== EOD UAV is an unmanned helicopter developed by Nobel Moral for explosive ordnance disposal. EOD UAV is primarily deployed in situation in which volatile gas linkage could not be stopped and thus must be ignited to burn the gas out. It is also deployed in the dispose of confiscated illegal fireworks. Development of EOD UAV was completed in May 2006 and it has entered service with Tonghua Fire Department. Specification: *Length (m): 1.55 *Width (m): 0.55 *Height (m): 0.68 ==Firefighting UAV== Firefighting UAV is an unmanned helicopter developed by Nobel Moral for applications in firefighting, and its primary mission is to develiver rope ladder to the victims who could not be reached by firefighters in time. Development of EOD UAV was completed in May 2006 and it has entered service since. Specification: *Length (m): 1.55 *Width (m): 0.55 *Height (m): 0.68 ==Harrier== Harrier UAV is an unmanned helicopter developed by Nobel Moral for Chinese military, and it is an all-metal helicopter drone designed as a replacement for target blimps used by Chinese air defense force for training. The shortcoming of blimp drone is that its manevorability cannot replicate that of helicopter, and Harrier is designed to meet this requirement. Design was completed in December 2003 and it has been in service with Chinese military since. Harrier is powered by methanol. ==Ka-50 drone== Nobel Moral Ka-50 drone is an unmanned helicopter developed by Nobel Moral originally for airshows, but has been adopted by Chinese military for training of the air defense force. The drone is mainly used to provide realistic visual identification training of the ground force and air crews. Ka-50 drone has entered service with People's Liberation Army antiaircraft artillery forces in Jinzhou. Specification: *Length (m): 1.25 *Width (m): 0.93 *Height (m): 0.5 ==Power line inspection UAV== 260 power line patrol UAV is an unmanned helicopter developed by Nobel Moral specifically for aerial inspection of overhead power lines. Development was completed in March 2003 and the UAV has been in service since, and has been deployed in Dalian in power line infrastructure construction. Specification: *Length (m): 2 *Width (m): 0.74 *Height (m): 0.72 ==PSYOP UAV== Psychological operation UAV is an unmanned helicopter developed by Nobel Moral for military and para-military operations, and it is directly developed from remotely controlled unmanned helicopters used in competitions. The unmanned helicopter has a more powerful engine and was deployed by Chinese military in psychological warfare operations, as well as aerial reconnaissance mission for post-strike battlefield assessment. The UAV went into service after the development completed in February 2006. ==See also== List of unmanned aerial vehicles of the People's Republic of China ==References== Category:Unmanned helicopters of China
