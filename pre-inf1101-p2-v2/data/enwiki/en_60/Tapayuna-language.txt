Tapayuna (Kajkwakhrattxi or Kajkwakhratxi, also spelt Tapajuna, Tapayuna: Kajkwakhrattxi kawere ) is a Northern Je language (Je, Macro-Je) spoken in Mato Grosso, Brazil by the Tapayuna (Kajkwakhrattxi) people. The Tapayuna historically lived on the Arinos River, in the Tapajos basin, between Juruena and Aripuana. They were decimated in mid-20th century as a result of numerous conflicts with Brazilian settlers, rubber tappers, and ranchers; it is estimated that their population declined 90% until reaching 41 individuals in 1969, which has been characterized as an ethnocide. The surviving Tapayuna were then transferred to Xingu Indigenous Park at some point between 1969 and 1970, resulting in 10 more deaths. At first, they stayed with the Kisedje, speakers of a closely related language. Later, many Tapayuna moved to Terra Indigena Capoto-Jarina, where they went on to live with the Metyktire subgroup of the Kayapo people, speakers of another Northern Je language, Mebengokre. It is assumed that the Tapayuna language has been influenced both by Kisedje and Mebengokre. In 2010, 97 speakers have been reported in the Kaweretxiko village (Capoto-Jarina). In contrast, only a few elders speak the language in the Ngosoko village (Wawi), where the Kisedje are the ethnic majority. The number of speakers in the Ngojhwere village (Wawi) is unknown. Tapayuna is closely related to Kisedje; together, they form the Tapajos branch of Northern Je. The common past on the Tapajos River, shared by the Tapayuna and the Kisedje, is still part of their oral history. Phonological differences between the languages include the reflexes of Proto-Northern Je *m/*mb, *mr/*mbr, *c (in onsets), *n (in codas), and *b (in stressed syllables). In Tapayuna, these consonants are reflected as w ([w]), nr ([r]), t ([t]), j ([j]), and w ([w]), respectively, whereas Kisedje has m/mb, mr/mbr, s, n, and p in the same words. ==Phonology== ===Consonants=== Tapayuna innovated with respect to Proto-Tapajos via the following sound changes: *merger of *th and *t as t /th/; **p > w /w/; **m(b), *m(b)r > w /w/, nr /r/; **khj, *mbj > x /tS/, j /j/; **-m, *-n, -n > /-p/, /-t/, /-j/. ===Vowels=== The vowel inventory of Tapayuna is shown below (the orthographic representation is given in italics; the characters in slashes stand for the IPA values of each vowel). {| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;" ! colspan="3" |Oral ! rowspan="5" | ! colspan="3" |Nasal |- |i /i/ |y /i/ |u /u/ |i /i/ |y /i/ |u /u/ |- |e /e/ |a /@/ |o /o/ |e /e/ | |o /o/ |- |e /e/ |a /^/ |o /o/ | |a /a/ | |- | |a /a/ | | | | |} ====Echo vowels==== Tapayuna has a phenomenon whereby an echo vowel is inserted in words whose underlying form ends in a consonant. The epenthesized vowels are unstressed, as in rowo ['rowo] 'jaguar', taga ['t^g^] 'bird', khogo ['khogo] 'wind'. ==Morphology== ===Inflectional morphology=== ====Finiteness==== As in all other Northern Je languages, verbs inflect for finiteness and thus have a basic opposition between a finite form (also Short Form and main form) and a nonfinite form (also Long Form). Finite forms are used in matrix clauses only, whereas nonfinite forms are used in all types of subordinate clauses as well as in some matrix clauses (including negated, future, and progressive clauses). Nonfinite forms are most often formed via suffixation and/or prefix substitution. Some verbs (including all descriptives with the exception of katho 'to leave', whose nonfinite form is kathoro) lack an overt finiteness distinction. The available nonfinite suffixes are /-r/ (the most common option, found in many transitive and intransitive verbs), /-j/ (found in transitive verbs and in some intransitives whose stem ends in the vowel /a/), as well as /-k/ and /-p/ (found in a handful of intransitive verbs which take a nominative subject when finite), as shown in the table below. {| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;" |+ Nonfinite suffixes in Tapayuna |- ! finite !! nonfinite !! gloss |- | colspan="3" | suffix /-r/ (/-j/ after /a/) |- | wo || woro || to go (plural) |- | wi || wiri || to kill (singular) |- | re || rere || to swim |- | wy || wyry || to take (singular) |- | twa || twara || to bathe |- | nghre || ngere || to dance |- | khre || khere || to eat (singular) |- | khu || khuru || to eat (plural) |- | ikhwa || khwara || to defecate |- | ithu || thuru || to urinate |- | awi || tawiri || to go up |- | colspan="3" | suffix /-j/ |- | we || wej || to scratch |- | wa || waj || to hear, to understand |- | kawa || kawaj || to extract (singular) |- | nta || ntaj || to bite |- | wu || wuj || to see |- | jare || jarej || to say |- | we || wej || to throw (singular) |- | kaho || kahoj || to wash |- | kuhwe || kuhwej || to sweep |- | ru || ruj || to spill |- | colspan="3" | suffix /-p/ |- | the || thew || to go (singular) |- | ikho || khow || to drink |- | ta || taw || to be, to stand (singular) |- | colspan="3" | suffix /-k/ |- | thy || thyk || to die |} In Proto-Northern Je, several verbs derived their finite forms by means of leniting the stem-final consonant (*-t, *-c, *-k - *-r, *-j, *-r). In Tapayuna, at least two verbs retain this pattern, though the relation between the finite and nonfinite forms has been obfuscated by a series of regular sound changes, including *-oj > -waj (-aj after a labial), *-c > -t. {| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;" |+ Nonfinite suffixes in Tapayuna |- ! finite !! nonfinite !! gloss !! Proto-Northern Je finite !! Proto-Northern Je nonfinite |- | ngoro || nhon || to sleep || *NGor || *not |- | waj || wot || to arrive || *boj || *boc |} ====The erstwhile palatalizing prefix==== In Proto-Northern Je, a small set of verbs formed their nonfinite forms by employing one of the aforementioned processes and a morphophonological process whereby the onset of the stressed syllable became palatal, and the nucleus of the stressed syllable was raised (if possible); this has been attributed to the influence of an underlying palatalizing nonfinite prefix. In Tapayuna, at least two verbs still follow the archaic pattern. {| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;" ! finite !! nonfinite !! gloss |- | ka || tara || to roast |- | ngoro || nhon || to sleep |} ====Prefix substitution or loss==== In addition to the aforementioned processes, the finiteness inflection may involve prefix substitution or loss. For example, the valency-reducing prefixes are a(j)- (anticausative) and a- (antipassive) in finite verb forms, but wi- and ta-/tu-, respectively, in the nonfinite forms. In addition, some verbs which denote physiological activities or movement have a prefix (i- and a-, respectively) in their finite forms but not in the nonfinite form. Some examples are given below. {| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;" ! finite !! nonfinite !! gloss |- | colspan="3" | anticausatives |- | ajkhe || wikhej || to have fun |- | colspan="3" | antipassives |- | awi || tawiri || to go up |- | colspan="3" | physiological verbs |- | ikho || khow || to drink |- | i'khwa || khwara || to defecate |- | ithu || thur || to urinate |- | colspan="3" | movement verbs |- | ata || tara || to enter (singular) |} ====Nominal number==== Nouns which denote human beings may receive the plural suffix -je, as in wewyje 'men' (- wewy) 'man'. ===Derivational morphology=== ====Productive affixes==== Tapayuna makes use of the diminutive suffixes -ti and -re, as well as of the augmentative suffix -txi. Examples include: tarati 'its small wing' or taratire 'its tiny wing' (- tara 'its wing', an inflected form of jara 'wing'), hryti 'small, narrow path' or hrytire 'a very narrow path' (- hry 'path'), thetxi 'tick' (- the), witxi 'alligator' (- wi). Nominalizations which denote instruments and places are formed by means of attaching the suffix -ta to the nonfinite form of a verb: kaho 'to sweep' - kahoj 'to sweep (nonfinite)' - kahojta 'broom'; we 'people' + khri 'to sit (plural, finite = nonfinite)' - wekhrita 'seat'. Agent nominalizations are formed by means of attaching the suffix -kane to the nonfinite form of a verb: hwito 'leaf; paper' + tok 'to paint; to write' - hwitotokkane 'teacher'. ==Lexicon== ===Predicate number=== Tapayuna commonly employs different lexemes for the so called singular and plural predicates (see Northern Je languages#Verbal number for more information about the semantic counterparts of this distinction in the Northern Je languages). {| class="wikitable" |+ Verbal number in Tapayuna |- ! singular !! plural !! gloss |- | kura || thithik || to hit |- | wi || hwa || to kill |- | te || wo || to go |} ==References== Category:Je languages Category:Languages of Brazil
