The Hardest Part is the second album by singer/songwriter Allison Moorer. The album is a concept album about a doomed relationship produced and co-written by Moorer's then husband Doyle Lee Primm. The album is based on her parents' relationship which ended in the mid-1980s when Moorer's father murdered her mother before killing himself. She told No Depression magazine in 2000: "This record was inspired by the things I saw my mother go through. It's not the true story, but it's inspired by the true story." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Jay Bennett - acoustic guitar, mellotron, piano * Richard Bennett - acoustic guitar * Chris Carmichael - fiddle * Chad Cromwell - drums * Eric Darken - percussion * Kenny Greenberg - 12-string acoustic guitar, acoustic guitar, electric guitar * Jim Hoke - harmonica * Allison Moorer - acoustic guitar, lead vocals * Louis Dean Nunley - background vocals * Russ Pahl - pedal steel guitar * Rick Plant - banjo, acoustic guitar, electric guitar * Michael Rhodes - bass guitar, upright bass * Rick Schell - background vocals * Joe Spivey - fiddle * Harry Stinson - background vocals * Marty Stuart - mandolin * Kris Wilkinson - string arrangements, conductor ==Chart performance== {| class="wikitable sortable" |- !
