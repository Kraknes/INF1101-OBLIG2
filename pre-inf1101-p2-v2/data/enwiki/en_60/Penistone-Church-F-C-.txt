In 1948 they were the first ever opponents of Sheffield Wednesday's youth team, in a Hatchard League fixture. When the Hatchard League merged with the Sheffield Association League, Penistone were founder members of the new Sheffield & Hallamshire County Senior League. They first reached the Premier Division in 1995 and were something of a yo-yo club during the 1990s, flitting between the Premier Division and Division One on numerous occasions. They finished as Premier Division runners-up in 2003 but would later spend yet another year in Division One after relegation in 2007. They finally established themselves as one of the top sides in the league during the early 2010s, and in 2014 they were promoted to the Northern Counties East League Division One, having made their FA Vase debut in 2013.Penistone Church Football Club History Database In 2016 they qualified for the inaugural Division One play-offs, but missed out on promotion to the Premier Division after losing their semi-final against AFC Emley, but a year later they beat the same opponents in a semi-final re-match before going on to beat Grimsby Borough in the final to win promotion to the Premier Division. ===Season-by- season record=== {| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed" style=text- align:center !
