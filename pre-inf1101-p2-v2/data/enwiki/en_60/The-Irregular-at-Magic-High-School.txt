However, the ability to use magic is determined by genetics, limiting the number of magicians in existence. Following the 20-year long Third World War that reduced the worlds population to 3 billion, the world's superpowers shifted to these four nations: The United States of North America (USNA), New Soviet Union, the Great Asian Alliance, and Japan. In Japan, the magic community is informally governed by the Ten Master Clans in lieu of the government. Due to the limited number of magicians, they are treated as a commodity and are forced to enter magic related schools and professions. Nine magic high schools exist in Japan; they each specialize in different aspects of magic and are simply referred to by their numbers. ===Plot=== The story follows Tatsuya Shiba, a bodyguard to his sister Miyuki Shiba who is also a candidate to succeed the leadership of the Yotsuba clan, one of the Ten Master Clans that govern Japan's magicians. They enroll into First High School which segregates its students based on their magical abilities. Miyuki is enrolled as a first course student and is viewed as one of the best students, while Tatsuya is in the second course and considered to be magically inept.

This premise served as a basis for the character, Tatsuya Shiba. Sato has two processes for scripting the story arcs: the first is to create scenarios to have characters behave and interact in certain ways; the second is to plan a scene, then script the story so it leads to that scene. Sato professed that he does not feel his characters are alive or have a will of their own when scripting them. Tsutomu Sato published his work on the online web novel website, Shosetsuka ni Naro, between October 12, 2008 and March 21, 2011. At some point during his publication on Syosetu, Sato sent an original work to Dengeki Bunko under a pseudonym. The original work's setting shared similarities to The Irregular at Magic High School causing an editor to deduce his identity and offer him a publication deal. On March 11, 2011, the author announced his work is going to be published as a light novel under the Dengeki Bunko imprint. The author expressed some regret turning free content into paid commodity and cited his financial needs as the reason. The illustrations accompanying the light novels were done by Kana Ishida. The first light novel volume was unable to accommodate the first story arc; deciding against cutting content from the web novel, it was split into two volumes and released a month later. On March 9, 2015, Yen Press announced its licensing of the light novels for English localization through Twitter. Yen Press' first volume was released in April 2016. In June 2020, it was announced that the novel series would be ending with its 32nd volume which is scheduled for released on September 10, 2020. In July 2020, both a direct book sequel and a new spinoff series was announced. The Sequel - The Irregular At Magic High School Magian Company (Zoku Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei Magian Company) began on October 10, 2020. The spinoff, New - The Irregular at Magic High School Maidens of Cygnus (Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei Cygnus no Otome-tachi) is scheduled for winter 2021. ===Volume list=== {| class="wikitable" style="text-align: left" |- ! scope="column" style="background: #CCF;" width="5%" rowspan=2| No. ! scope="column" style="background: #CCF;" width="35%" rowspan=2| Translated title ! scope="column" style="background: #CCF;" colspan=2| Japanese ! scope="column" style="background: #CCF;" colspan=2| English |- style="border- bottom:3px; solid; background: #CCF;" ! scope="column" style="background: #CCF;" "width="7%"| Release ! scope="column" style="background: #CCF;" "width="3%"| ISBN ! scope="column" style="background: #CCF;" "width="5%"| Release ! scope="column" style="background: #CCF;" "width="5%"| ISBN |- !scope="row" |1 |style="text-align: left"| |July 10, 2011 | |April 19, 2016 | |- |colspan="6" style="background: #FFFFFF; text-align: left"|The siblings Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba begin their first day at First High School, one of the nine magic high schools in Japan; the school segregates its students as first course or second course based on overall magic ability.

The fourth reviewer, Jacob Chapman, expressed immediate dislike towards the series, criticizing it for lacking anything to engage the viewers and for being a lazy adaptation of a light novel, and concluding the review with "I can't even remember the last time I saw something with not a single redeeming factor or thing to recommend about it at all." Silverman reviewed the series future episodes. Plotwise, she praised the Enrollment Arcs underline on standardized testing, criticized the Nine Schools Competition Arc for its execution and weak exposition, and felt the characters were uninteresting. Silverman felt the series doesn't live up to its potential and cited the background music and stilted animations as possible reasons. Chris Beveridge's review for Fandom Post was highly positive towards the anime series, calling it a dark horse contender as one of their top new anime series of the year. Beveridge praised the technical and fundamental aspects of magic in the series for breaking the supernatural approach other works usually take and liked the potential impact it could have on future events. However, while the reviewer liked the series' technicality, they noted it will frustrate certain viewers in that aspect. Richard Eisenbeis, writing for Kotaku, liked the characters, story, the complex and technical magic system, and mysteries. However, Eisenbeis criticized the exposition, citing it to be poorly timed, heavy, and failing to explain things with better clarity. He concluded his review by writing how the anime might have been great if a different director or screenwriting was hired. ==Notes== ; Works cited * represents the Light Novel of the series in the format of X.Y, where X represents the volume and Y represents the chapter.
