Sheila Nirenberg is an American neuroscientist. She works in the field of neural coding, developing new kinds of prosthetic devices that can communicate directly with the brain, and new kinds of smart robots. She is a recipient of a MacArthur "genius" award and has been the subject of, or featured in, several documentaries for her technology for treating blindness. She is currently the Nanette Laitman Professor in Neurology and Neuroscience and a professor of Computational Neuroscience in the Institute for Computational Biomedicine at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University. Additionally, she is the founder of two startup companies, Bionic Sight LLC (prosthetic devices) and Nirenberg Neuroscience LLC (smart robots, AI). == Early life and education == Nirenberg grew up in Westchester, New York, United States. She attended the University of Albany where she gained a BA in psychology with a minor in English. She completed her PhD at Harvard University in 1993, where she worked with Constance Cepko, a neurobiologist who was studying development and degeneration of the vertebrate retina. Nirenberg's project focused on developing a new technique to kill specific cell types in the retina in order to understand their function. == Research career == Nirenberg stayed at Harvard University for her postdoctoral work before moving to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) where she was assistant professor for six years. She was then recruited to Cornell University in 2005. A few years later, she was able to decipher the retina's neural code, the language communicating to your brain what you're seeing. This discovery allowed her to develop potential prosthetics to bypass damaged retinal cells in patients and directly communicate visual information to the brain. Nirenberg has published her research in journals such as Nature, PNAS, Neuron, and PLoS One. == Awards and honors == * Beckman Young Investigators Award * Klingenstein Fellowship, 1998 * Frontiers of Science Award * Stein Oppenheimer Award ==References== ==External links== * Nirenberg Lab Website, Cornell University Category:American neuroscientists Category:American women neuroscientists Category:Weill Medical College of Cornell University faculty Category:University at Albany, SUNY alumni Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:MacArthur Fellows
