Ulrich I, Duke of Brno (, , ; died 5 January 1113) was the Duke of Moravia for twenty one years - between 1092 and 1113. He was the first son and successor of Conrad I, of Brno (died 1092) and Wirpirk of Tengling. He did not succeed as half ruler of Moravia (diarch), for all half of Moravia (the west one) as his father Conrad I, but Brno was divided into two parts: Brno and Znojmo and Ulrich was co-ruler in this part with his brother Luitpold of Znojmo.Cosmae Pragensis Chronica Boemorum III.15, p. 176-177Cronicle of the Czech (English by Wolverton) III.15, p. 176-177 Both brothers together established a benedictine cloister and its St. Procopius Basilica in Trebic and prepared as mausoleum for Brno-Znojmo branch House of Premyslid. He had long ruled over Moravia (as diarch in Brno) for 21 years, once interrupted by illegitimate regency: (1099-1100 by Bretislaus II) By his marriage to an unknown princess, he probably had two children:Person is unknown, but names of both children indicate probably slavic origin of princess (mother) - Polish or Kievan *Vratislav (or Wratislaus), Duke of Brno from 1125 to 1129 and from 1130 to his death in 1146 *Nadia (?),(or Nadine, original Nadiia, Czech Nadej) He was succeeded legitimately as prince of Brno by his son Wratislaus of Brno. == Domestic policy == Burial place in Benedictine Abbey, Trebic Ulrich and Luitpold initially ruled in the Brno part (the western one) of the duchy of Moravia, until 1099 when they were evicted illegitimately by Bretislaus II. Later they enforced a return of the Brno part of the Moravian duchy - with the help of the Bavarian armed troops as well as indirect support by Emperor Henry IV (whom he visited in early February 1101 in Frankfurt), according to the principles of agnatic seniority. After they returned to the duchy of Brno, the brothers divided it into two subparts named Brno (principality) and Znojmo (principality), where they continued to reign in certain local territorial union. In 1104 they together founded a Benedictine abbey in Trebic whose convent church of St. Procopius was intended as their own dynastic mausoleum where they were both buried. Emperor Henry IV gave Ulrich insignia of rank and banner (vexillum) for their reign in the duchy. All the Moravian lines of Premysl dynasty as a whole were systematically associated with dynastic marriages with princesses of major royal and ducal dynasties, especially Arpad dynasty, Rurik dynasty, Piast dynasty, Nemanjic dynasty-senior line Vukanovic Daughter Maria of Uros I, of Rascia and houses of bavarian monarchs, as it was the other way around (vice versa). Members of the Moravian dynasty were fully predisposed to take over the central throne (for both countries - Bohemia and Moravia) in Prague, under the principles of agnatic seniority. == Family tree == {| width="100%" style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" |- | colspan="2" | Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia d. 6 September 1055 | colspan="2" | | colspan="2" | Judith of Schweinfurt d. after 1052 | colspan="2" | | colspan="2" | Sieghard VII of Tengling d. 5 July 1044 | colspan="2" | | colspan="2" | Philihild of Andechs d. 23 October 1075 |- | style="border-right:1px black solid;" | | colspan="4" style="border-bottom:1px black solid; border-right:1px black solid;" | | colspan="4" style="" | | colspan="4" style="border-bottom:1px black solid; border-left:1px black solid;" | | style="border-left:1px black solid;" | |- | colspan="3" | | colspan="8" style="border-left:1px black solid; border- right:1px black solid;" | | colspan="3" | |- | colspan="2" | | colspan="2" | Conrad I, Duke of Brno d. 10 January 1092 | colspan="6" | | colspan="2" | Wirpirk of Tengling d.after 1052 | colspan="2" | |- | colspan="3" style="border-right:1px black solid;" | | colspan="8" style="border-bottom:1px black solid;" | | colspan="3" style="border-left:1px black solid;" | |- | colspan="7" style="border-right:1px black solid;" | | colspan="7" | |- | width="7.14%"| | width="7.14%"| | width="7.14%"| | width="7.14%"| | width="7.14%"| | width="7.14%"| | width="7.14%"| | width="7.14%"| | width="7.14%"| | width="7.14%"| | width="7.14%"| | width="7.14%"| | width="7.14%"| | width="7.14%"| |- |} {| style="width:100%; text-align:center; vertical-align:top;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" |- style="vertical- align:top;" | colspan="2" | | colspan="2" style="vertical-align:middle;" | Unknown princess (Adelheid ??) d. ?
