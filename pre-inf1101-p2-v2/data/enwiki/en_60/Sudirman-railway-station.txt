Sudirman Station (SUD) () is a train station of Commuterline, which is located in Menteng, Central Jakarta. The station is named from Jalan Jenderal Sudirman, one of the main avenue in Jakarta, which crosses above the station. This station is located on the north bank of West Flood Canal. Though this station serves only Commuterline trains, but it is a transit point for other types of public transportation as part of Dukuh Atas TOD. Distance between this station and Karet railway station is one of the shortest in the network, measuring only 0.8 km between each stations.

As the station is located in Jakarta's CBD and is surrounded by some of the most prominent buildings and places in Jakarta, therefore the station is always crowded, especially in rush hour. == Public transport == * Transjakarta Corridor 1, 4, 6 * Transjakarta Express Pulo Gadung-Bundaran Senayan (Mon-Fri) * Transjakarta Express Kalideres-Bundaran Senayan (Mon-Fri) * Transjakarta Express National Monument-Ragunan (Mon-Fri) * APTB Transjakarta APTB 04 patas to Ciputat (via Hayam Wuruk - Thamrin - Sudirman - Blok M - Radio Dalam - Pondok Indah - Lebak Bulus) * APTB Transjakarta APTB 07A patas to Bekasi (via Thamrin - Sudirman - Komdak - Bekasi Barat) * APTB Transjakarta APTB 07B patas to Bekasi (via Thamrin - Sudirman - Komdak - Bekasi Timur) * APTB Transjakarta APTB 08A patas to Bekasi (via Thamrin - Sudirman - Komdak - Bekasi Timur) * APTB Transjakarta APTB 08B patas to Mega Bekasi Hypermall (via Thamrin - Sudirman - Komdak - Bekasi Barat) *Jakarta MRT Dukuh Atas Station ==Places of Interest== *Selamat Datang Monument *Hotel Indonesia *Grand Indonesia Shopping Town *Plaza Indonesia *Taman Suropati *Menteng Park *BCA Tower *Mandarin Hotel Jakarta *Embassy of Germany in Jakarta *Embassy of Japan in Jakarta *Sarinah (can also be accessed from Gondangdia railway station) ==References== ==External links== * category:central Jakarta Category:Railway stations in Jakarta
