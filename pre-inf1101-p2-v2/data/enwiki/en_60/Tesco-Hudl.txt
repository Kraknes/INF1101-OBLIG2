The Tesco Hudl is a tablet computer launched by British retailer Tesco in 2013. The device features a seven-inch screen, a 1.5 GHz quad-core processor and 16 GB of internal flash memory (expandable up to 64 GB). The Hudl runs the Android Jelly Bean operating system and was manufactured by Wistron. In April 2014, it was announced that Tesco had sold 500,000 Hudl tablets since launch, and a new model was planned. The second generation Hudl 2 was announced in October 2014. However, in October 2015 the brand was discontinued. ==Rooting== The Tesco Hudl is mostly vanilla Android with only some vendor customisation, and therefore can be rooted. The root requires users to flash an altered file which grants root permissions. ==Accessories== A range of accessories were available for the device including a leather case, a soft-touch case, ear-bud headphones, children's headphones, a protective bumper case, a screen protection kit and recharging cables. ==References== == External links == * Category:Tablet computers Category:Tesco Category:Touchscreen portable media players Category:Tablet computers introduced in 2013
