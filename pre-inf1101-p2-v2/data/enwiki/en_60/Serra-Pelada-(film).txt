"When I had the idea of the film, I thought: ' why had nobody thought of doing this movie before? ' And when I was filming I understood why. It was almost impossible to be done. It was very complex. It was the hardest film I've ever done". According to Dhalia, it was hard to tell the story of a camp which focused on men living in precarious conditions and facing orders from the owners of the operating areas. "We're talking about a fairly important Brazilian event of our recent history. The biggest gold rush of the modern era. Highest concentration of manual labor since the pyramids of Egypt, which had 4,000 men. In Serra Pelada there were around 100,000 men working".Filme Serra Pelada e destaque no encerramento do Festival do Rio - Portal Vermelho ===Filming=== The film was going to be shot in Para, but ended up being filmed in Paulinia, Sao Paulo, after Vale and the Amazonian State Government denied support for the production. The producer Tatiana Quintella confirmed that Vale vetoed the filming in Para, but explained that running the production there would be unworkable. "We had no budget for the logistics and security of our team. So we decided to shoot the film in Sao Paulo". ==References== == External links == * Category:Brazilian films Category:2013 films Category:Brazilian drama films Category:Gold mining in Brazil Category:Films shot in Paulinia Category:Films directed by Heitor Dhalia Category:Films set in the 1970s Category:Mining in film
