Wolf Hall is a British television serial first broadcast on BBC Two in January 2015. The six-part series is an adaptation of two of Hilary Mantel's novels, Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies, a fictionalised biography documenting the rapid rise to power of Thomas Cromwell in the court of Henry VIII through to the death of Sir Thomas More, followed by Cromwell's success in freeing the king of his marriage to Anne Boleyn. Wolf Hall was first broadcast in April 2015 in the United States on PBS and in Australia on BBC First. The series was a critical success and received eight nominations at the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards and three nominations at the 73rd Golden Globe Awards, winning for Best Miniseries or Television Film. ==Cast== ===Principal=== * Mark Rylance as Thomas CromwellCast & Credits, Wolf Hall, PBS. * Damian Lewis as Henry VIII * Claire Foy as Anne Boleyn * Bernard Hill as Duke of Norfolk * Anton Lesser as Thomas More * Mark Gatiss as Stephen Gardiner * Mathieu Amalric as Eustache Chapuys * Joanne Whalley as Katherine of Aragon * Jonathan Pryce as Cardinal Wolsey * Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Rafe Sadler * Tom Holland as Gregory Cromwell * Harry Lloyd as Harry Percy * Jessica Raine as Jane Rochford * Saskia Reeves as Johane Williamson * Charity Wakefield as Mary Boleyn * Edward Holcroft as George Boleyn ===Supporting=== * David Robb as Sir Thomas Boleyn * Joss Porter as Richard Cromwell * Emma Hiddleston as Meg More * Jonathan Aris as James Bainham * Natasha Little as Liz Cromwell * Will Keen as Thomas Cranmer * Ed Speleers as Edward Seymour * Kate Phillips as Jane Seymour * Hannah Steele as Mary Shelton * Richard Dillane as Duke of Suffolk * Florence Bell as Helen Barre * Iain Batchelor as Thomas Seymour * Paul Clayton as William Kingston * Felix Scott as Francis Bryan * Luke Roberts as Harry Norris * Alastair Mackenzie as William Brereton * Max Fowler as Mark Smeaton * Robert Wilfort as George Cavendish * Aimee-Ffion Edwards as Elizabeth Barton * Bryan Dick as Richard Rich * Lucy Russell as Lady Shelton * Kerry Ingram as Alice Williamson * Enzo Cilenti as Antonio Bonvisi * James Larkin as Master Treasurer FitzWilliam * Tim Steed as Lord Chancellor Audley * Joel MacCormack as Thomas Wriothesley * Jacob Fortune-Lloyd as Francis Weston * Paul Ritter as Sir John Seymour * Sarah Crowden as Lady Exeter * Janet Henfrey as Lady Margaret Pole * Thomas Arnold as Hans Holbein the Younger * Nigel Cooke as Sir Nicholas Carew * Benjamin Whitrow as Archbishop Warham * Richard Durden as Bishop Fisher ==Production== On 23 August 2012, BBC Two announced several new commissions, one of which was Wolf Hall. According to The Guardian PS7 million was to be spent on the adaptation. BBC Two controller Janice Hadlow said it was "very fortunate to have the rights" to the two novels and called Wolf Hall "a great contemporary novel". Peter Kosminsky, the director of the series, said: > This is a first for me. But it is an intensely political piece. It is about > the politics of despotism, and how you function around an absolute ruler. I > have a sense that Hilary Mantel wanted that immediacy. ... When I saw Peter > Straughan's script, only a first draft, I couldn't believe what I was > reading. It was the best draft I had ever seen. He had managed to distil > 1,000 pages of the novels into six hours, using prose so sensitively. He's a > theatre writer by trade. The drama series features 102 characters and Kosminsky began casting the other parts in October 2013. Although originally set to film in Belgium, most of the filming took place on location at some of the finest British medieval and Tudor houses and buildings: Berkeley Castle, Gloucester Cathedral and Horton Court in Gloucestershire, Penshurst Place in Kent, Broughton Castle and Chastleton House in Oxfordshire, Barrington Court, Cothay Manor and Montacute House in Somerset, St Donat's Castle in the Vale of Glamorgan, and Great Chalfield Manor and Lacock Abbey in Wiltshire. The series was filmed from May to July 2014. The series, which was made in association with Masterpiece Entertainment and Playground Entertainment, consists of six episodes and was broadcast on BBC Two in the UK from 21 January 2015. The Guardian speculated that the BBC's hiring of Kosminsky with Straughan showed they wanted "a darker and grittier take on British history" than more fanciful programmes such as The Tudors or The White Queen. Mantel called Straughan's scripts a "miracle of elegant compression and I believe with such a strong team the original material can only be enhanced." Kosminsky's decision to film many of the interior scenes by candlelight led to the actors bumping into things, and fearing they might catch fire. Wolf Hall was filmed in two locations in Kent: Dover Castle doubled for the Tower of London, and the Long Gallery, Tapestry Room, and Queen Elizabeth Room at Penshurst Place were used as specific rooms in Whitehall (York Place), which was Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII's residence. The Long Gallery doubled as Anne Boleyn's chamber. Some scenes were filmed at Stanway House in Gloucestershire. The series' executive producer, Colin Callender, stated in February 2015 that he hoped that the BBC would commission an extension of the series based on the final novel in Mantel's trilogy, The Mirror and the Light, which was published in 2020.Ben Dowell, BBC poised to commission Wolf Hall series two, Radio Times, (9 February 2015).

A second series of Wolf Hall was confirmed on 27 May 2019. ==Episodes== {| class="wikitable plainrowheaders" style="width: 100%; margin-right: 0;" |- ! style="background:#F0863A; color: #ffffff;"| Number ! style="background:#F0863A; color: #ffffff;"| Title ! style="background:#F0863A; color: #ffffff;"| Directed by ! style="background:#F0863A; color: #ffffff;"| Written by ! style="background:#F0863A; color: #ffffff;"| Original air date ! style="background:#F0863A; color: #ffffff;"| U.S. air dateLisa de Moraes, 'Wolf Hall' Premiere Crowd Hits 4.4 Million, Deadline Hollywood (30 April 2015). ! style="background:#F0863A; color: #ffffff;"| UK viewers (million) |- |} ==Reception== Critics have been "almost unanimous" in their praise of the series, with particular reference to the attention to period detail, the faithful adaptation of the source novels, Kosminsky's direction, and the performances of the leading cast members, particularly Rylance as Cromwell and Foy as Boleyn. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the show a 98% rating based on 41 reviews with an average rating of 8.45/10, the critical consensus being that the series is "beautifully filmed and brilliantly acted." Sam Wollaston in The Guardian called it "sumptuous, intelligent, event television." Will Dean in The Independent felt that it did not compare favourably with the stage adaptation of the book, yet he predicted that it would "secure a devoted following." James Walton in The Daily Telegraph gave the first episode five stars out of five, commenting: "it's hard to see how this one could have been done much better." Mick Adam Noya from the television review show Channel Crossing called Wolf Hall "the best show of 2015". Channel Crossing: Wolf Hall Review (Best TV of 2015) A few dissenting voices found some flaws. The Daily Telegraph alleged that there was a substantial drop in ratings between the first and second episode, despite all the following episodes holding high and consistent ratings.Anita Singh, Wolf Hall a turn-off as a million viewers switch over, The Daily Telegraph, 29 January 2015 Simon Schama stated concerns about how the series depicted historical figures. Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker cited "small weaknesses", but wrote "the show's deliberately paced six hours turn out to be riveting, precisely because they are committed, without apology or, often, much explanation, to the esotericism of their subject matter." The lighting design, which utilized historically accurate natural light sources (such as candlelight for evening scenes) prompted criticism from viewers who felt parts of the series were presented too dark. == International broadcast == * Australia: BBC First premiered the series on 11 April 2015 and it was watched by 46,000 viewers. * United States: PBS broadcast the series on Masterpiece from 5 April 2015 to 10 May 2015.
