Paugnut State Forest is a Connecticut state forest located on four parcels in the towns of Torrington and Winchester. The forest's Arts and Crafts-style administration building was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1937 and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The remains of the foundation of the condensed milk factory established by Gail Borden on Burr Pond in 1857 may also be seen. Trails crossing the forest include the John Muir Trail which connects Burr Pond State Park and Sunnybrook State Park. ==References== ==External links== *Paugnut State Forest Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection *Paugnut State Forest Map Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Category:Connecticut state forests Category:Parks in Litchfield County, Connecticut Category:Torrington, Connecticut Category:Protected areas established in 1929 Category:1929 establishments in Connecticut Category:Civilian Conservation Corps in Connecticut
