is the third remix album by P-Model. ==Overview== The album consists of a selection of rearrangements of older songs played by the "defrosted" lineup of the band in their style. Besides these songs, the "defrosted" P-Model also performed nine other songs from older albums (including In a Model Room, Landsale and Scuba, which are not represented in this selection) that did not receive studio remixes. It is part of a pair of conceptual takes on a live album, alongside Pause: For this album, Hirasawa aimed to replicate the songs as they sounded to the band members. Since the band heard their music on stage coming from multiple speakers/monitors, they got a "flood" of distorted sound. As such, the album was mastered to bring out harshness and loudness, aiming to replicate that situation as well as the tension and the intensity of the formation's live shows. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Susumu Hirasawa - Vocals, Synthesizer, Guitar, Computer programming, Amiga *Hikaru Kotobuki - Synthesizer, Computer programming, Amiga, Vocoder, Backing Vocals *Kayo "Kokubo" Matsumoto - "MAMA" Vocal on "OH!
