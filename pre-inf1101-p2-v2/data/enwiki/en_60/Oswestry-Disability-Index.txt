The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is an index derived from the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire used by clinicians and researchers to quantify disability for low back pain. This validated questionnaire was first published by Jeremy Fairbank et al. in Physiotherapy in 1980.Fairbank JC, Couper J, Davies JB. The Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire. Physiotherapy 1980; 66: 271-273. The current version was published in the journal Spine in 2000.Fairbank JC, Pynsent PB. The Oswestry Disability Index.

Each topic category is followed by 6 statements describing different potential scenarios in the patient's life relating to the topic. The patient then checks the statement which most closely resembles their situation. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement is scored 5 indicating most severe disability. The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible. ==Scoring== *0% -20%: Minimal disability *21%-40%: Moderate Disability *41%-60%: Severe Disability *61%-80%: Crippling back pain *81%-100%: These patients are either bed-bound or have an exaggeration of their symptoms. ==References== ==External links== *MAPI Research Trust site with information about licensing, along with access to a review copy of the questionnaire *ODI FACEBOOK PAGE Oswestry Disability Index Facebook Page *Evidencio: Medical decision support Online Calculator of the Oswestry Disability Index Category:Medical scoring system Category:Medical diagnosis Category:Bones of the vertebral column Category:Pain scales
