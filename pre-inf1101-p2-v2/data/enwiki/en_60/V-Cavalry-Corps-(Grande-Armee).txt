The V Cavalry Corps of the Grande Armee was a French military unit that existed during the Napoleonic Wars. The corps was created in 1813 and fought until 1814. Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte first organized the corps during the summer armistice in 1813 and it fought at Dresden and Leipzig. General Samuel- Francois Lheritier led the corps at first but was replaced by General Pierre Claude Pajol. After Pajol was wounded at Leipzig, General Edouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud commanded the corps at Hanau in 1813 and at Brienne, La Rothiere, Mormant, Fere-Champenoise, and Paris in 1814. ==History== ===1813=== After the disastrous invasion of Russia, Napoleon had to rebuild his armies in Germany. By 1 May 1813, the French emperor was ready to lead an army numbering 226,177 troops and 457 artillery pieces. However, his cavalry was its weakest element. Between mid-April and 1 May, it was organized into the I Cavalry Corps with 3,515 officers and men, the II Cavalry Corps with 3,293 sabers, and the III Cavalry Corps with 3,895 troopers. On 25 March, General Jean Antoine de Collaert was assigned to lead the 1st Brigade of General Samuel-Francois Lheritier's 4th Cavalry Division in General Jean-Toussaint Arrighi de Casanova's III Cavalry Corps. After a reorganization, the division became part of the V Cavalry Corps on 10 August. From that day until 5 October, Collaert became the acting commander of the 5th Dragoon Division. Two divisions of the V Cavalry Corps were made up of dragoons, as shown here. By the time the summer armistice ended on 17 August 1813, Lheritier commanded the V Cavalry Corps which numbered about 4,000 horsemen in 20 squadrons supported by 6 guns.Maude (1908), p. 148 In its initial disposition, Lheritier's corps was posted near Dresden together with the XIV Corps under Marshal Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr.Petre (1912), p. 172 As the Allied Army of Bohemia advanced from the south, the V Cavalry Corps covered the left flank during Saint-Cyr's fighting withdrawal. On 25 August, Lheritier lost 3 guns in a skirmish with Russian cavalry outside Dresden.Petre (1912), p. 192 Samuel Francois Lheritier Lheritier's corps was present during the Battle of Dresden on 26 and 27 August 1813. Its three divisions were led by Generals Stanislaw Klicki, Collaert, and Auguste Etienne Lamotte. Klicki led the 9th Light Cavalry Division, Collaert directed the 5th Dragoon Division, and Lamotte commanded the 6th Dragoon Division. Meanwhile, General Pierre Claude Pajol led the 10th Light Cavalry Division which belonged to Saint-Cyr's corps. Pajol's division counted 4 squadrons each of French, Italians, and Poles. On the 26th, Pajol appeared to have taken command of Lheritier's corps as well as his own division because one authority stated that he controlled 46 cavalry squadrons while the commander of the I Cavalry Corps General Victor de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg directed 78 more. This mass of cavalry was deployed to the east of Dresden in the Friederichstadt suburb.Petre (1912), p. 203 Yet, the same source assigned only 68 squadrons to La Tour-Maubourg and Pajol for battle on the 27th.Petre (1912), p. 212 Beginning at 6:00 AM, the cavalry supported by Marshal Claude Perrin Victor's II Corps advanceed against the outnumbered Austrian left wing. The attack was a complete success and by 2:00 PM, the Austrian defenders were almost annihilated, losing 15,000 prisoners.Petre (1912), pp. 218-221 Of the V Cavalry Corps, only the 26th and 27th Chasseurs-a-Cheval and 19th Dragoon Regiments were engaged. On 26 September 1813, the V Cavalry Corps, still under Lheritier, was posted at Grossenhain.Petre (1912), p. 293 On 2 October, the corps was placed under the orders of Marshal Joachim Murat along with the II, V, and VIII Corps. Murat was ordered to Freiberg to defend against another advance by the Army of Bohemia.Petre (1912), p. 300 On the 14th, Murat stood to fight south of Leipzig at Liebertwolkwitz with 32,400 infantry, 9,800 cavalry, and 156 guns. The contending forces included Murat's command plus the IV Cavalry Corps and one division of the I Cavalry Corps. The outcome was a drawn battle in which both sides held their positions. The V Cavalry Corps, now under the command of Pajol, was so badly "knocked about" that it was temporarily out of action.Petre (1912), p. 318-319 At the Battle of Leipzig on 16-19 October, Pajol led 5,000 troopers and 11 guns in 3 divisions under Generals Jacques Gervais, baron Subervie, Lheritier, and Edouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud. Subervie led the 9th Light Cavalry Division, Lheritier directed the 5th Heavy Cavalry Division, and Milhaud commanded the 6th Heavy Cavalry Division.Smith (1998), p. 463 Early on the 16th, the I and V Cavalry Corps and the Imperial Guard cavalry were placed in reserve in the southern sector.Petre (1912), p. 330 On the 18th, the V Cavalry Corps supported the II Corps to the south of Leipzig.Petre (1912), p. 354 At 4:00 PM on 18 October, the I, III, and V Cavalry Corps were withdrawn from the battlefield.Petre (1912), p. 368 Pajol was among the many woundedPetre (1912), p. 384 and was replaced by Milhaud in command of the corps. During the retreat after Leipzig, Milhaud and Lheritier led the 15th and 18th Dragoons in action at Eckartsberga on 22 October. The French successfully parried an attempt by General Ignaz Gyulai's III Armeekorps to cut off their escape route.Smith (1998), p. 472 The 19th and 20th Dragoons and the 14th and 27th Chasseurs-a-Cheval from the V Cavalry Corps participated in the Battle of Hanau on 30-31 October.Smith (1998), p. 474 By late November, Milhaud's V Cavalry Corps covered the Left Bank of the Rhine from Mainz in the north to near Landau in the south. The corps numbered 3,973 horsemen of whom 300 patrolled the river every day between Mainz and Worms. ===1814=== Edouard Milhaud By the end of January 1814, Allied columns brushed aside the weak forces defending the borders and invaded France. Napoleon resolved to move against them with the Imperial Guard, II and VI Corps, and the I and V Cavalry Corps, a total of 33,000 infantry and 8,000 cavalry. In a clash at Saint-Dizier on 27 January, 2,100 troopers belonging to Milhaud's cavalry defeated 1,500 men of the Russian 2nd Hussar Division. The French units involved in the skirmish were the 5th Chevau-Leger Lancers, the 10th and 26th Chasseurs-a-Cheval, and the 2nd, 11th, 13th, and 19th Dragoons.Smith (1998), p. 490 At the Battle of Brienne on 29 January, the V Cavalry Corps led the attack. In overall command of the cavalry, General Emmanuel de Grouchy placed General Hippolyte Pire with the light cavalry division on the left, Lheritier's dragoons in the center, and some Imperial Guard cavalry on the right. Before 3:00 PM, the horsemen swept forward, driving back General Pyotr Pahlen's Russian cavalry. In their pursuit, the dragoon divisions of Lheritier and General Andre Louis Briche came across three Russian battalions in square formations and were repulsed. The cavalry was then shifted to cover the French right flank during the remainder of the battle. The corps also fought at the Battle of La Rothiere on 1 February. Late in the day, Napoleon threw in Milhaud's corps to cover the disengagement of his outnumbered and defeated army. On 6 February 1814, Marshal Jacques MacDonald reported that his cavalry was in a bad state. He wrote that the V Cavalry Corps numbered 800 sabers which was half their nominal strength. The III Cavalry Corps numbered only 500 while the II Cavalry Corps had between 800 and 900 troopers. On the 10th, the III and V Cavalry Corps and General Antoine-Louis Decrest de Saint-Germain massed at Meaux to cover a river crossing. The combined force was 2,000 horsemen and 5 guns. Milhaud led the divisions of Pire and Briche at the Battle of Mormant on 17 February. At this time, Lheritier's division was transferred to the newly formed VI Cavalry Corps.Smith (1998), p. 498 Milhaud's V Cavalry Corps participated in the Battle of Fere-Champenoise on 25 March, including the 23rd Chasseurs-a-Cheval and the 5th, 6th, 21st, 25th, and 26th Dragoons.Smith (1998), p. 514 The 6th Dragoon Division fought under the command of General Nicolas-Francois Roussel d'Hurbal at the Battle of Paris on 30 March.Smith (1998), p. 515 ==Order of battle== ===Leipzig, 1813=== Pierre Claude Pajol V Cavalry Corps: General of Division Pierre Claude Pajol (5,000) * 9th Light Cavalry Division: General of Division Jacques Gervais, baron Subervie (1,700) ** 32nd Light Cavalry Brigade: General of Brigade Stanislaw Klicki *** 3rd Hussar Regiment (3 squadrons) *** 27th Chasseurs-a-Cheval Regiment (4 squadrons) ** 33rd Light Cavalry Brigade: General of Brigade Jacques Laurent Vial *** 13th Hussar Regiment (4 squadrons) *** 14th Chasseurs-a-Cheval Regiment (3 squadrons) *** 26th Chasseurs-a-Cheval Regiment (3 squadrons) * 5th Heavy Cavalry Division: General of Division Samuel-Francois Lheritier (1,700) ** Heavy Cavalry Brigade: General of Brigade Mathieu Queunot *** 2nd Dragoon Regiment (3 squadrons) *** 6th Dragoon Regiment (4 squadrons) ** Heavy Cavalry Brigade: General of Brigade Jean Antoine de Collaert *** 11th Dragoon Regiment (4 squadrons) *** 13th Dragoon Regiment (2 squadrons) *** 15th Dragoon Regiment (3 squadrons) * 6th Heavy Cavalry Division: General of Division Edouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud (1,600) ** Heavy Cavalry Brigade: General of Brigade Auguste Etienne Lamotte *** 18th Dragoon Regiment (2 squadrons) *** 19th Dragoon Regiment (2 squadrons) *** 20th Dragoon Regiment (3 squadrons) ** Heavy Cavalry Brigade: General of Brigade Gabriel Gaspard Montelegier *** 22nd Dragoon Regiment (3 squadrons) *** 25th Dragoon Regiment (4 squadrons) * Corps Artillery: ** Horse artillery (11 guns) Sources: * *'' ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * * * * GAC05
