Snuff were an American country rock/rockabilly band based in Southern Virginia and active during the 1970s and early 1980s. They released a pair of albums and scored a minor hit on the pop charts with "Bad, Bad Billy" in 1983. ==Career== Snuff initially formed in the 1970s and began as an acoustic trio featuring guitarist James Gray "Jimbo" Bowling, guitarist Bill Wampler, and vocalist Mike Jones. However, the group gradually incorporated more of an electric sound into their repertoire, and by the 1980s, they had evolved into a six-member outfit, including Bowling, guitarist Robbie House, lead vocalist/acoustic guitarist Chuck "Coyote" Larson, bassist C. Scott Trabue, violinist Cecil Hooker, and drummer/percussionist Michael A. Johnson.Snuff - History of the Band Retrieved 10-12-2013. The group released their eponymous debut album in 1982.

The group was popular in the Virginia area, as well as Washington, DC into the early 1980s. Later in the decade, Robbie House left the group to form the band Street Talk, and he was replaced by guitarist Norman Harrell. However, they could not duplicate the success they achieved with "Bad, Bad Billy," and the group faded from public view. ==Currently== Larson and House, who had originally comprised the duo Robbie and Coyote prior to joining Snuff, join regularly with Norman Harrell and other musicians to perform under the Snuff moniker. In early September 2013, Larson, House, and Harrell reunited with Cecil Hooker and Michael Johnson from the classic Snuff lineup to perform at Hampton, Virginia's annual Bay Days festival.McDonald, Sam (2013).
