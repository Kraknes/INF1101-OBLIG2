Sydney River-Mira-Louisbourg is a provincial electoral district in Nova Scotia, Canada, that elects one member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. The riding is represented by Brian Comer of the Progressive Conservative Party."MacLeod takes Sydney River-Mira-Louisbourg" Cape Breton Post, October 8, 2013. In 1925, the County of Cape Breton and neighbouring Richmond County were divided into three distinct electoral districts, one of which was named Richmond-West Cape Breton. In 1933, on the recommendations of the 1932 Electoral Boundaries Commission, Richmond-West Cape Breton was dissolved and two new districts were created, one of which was Cape Breton West, which also took in parts of Cape Breton Centre and Cape Breton East. In 2003, this district had minor adjustments to its boundaries with Cape Breton South, Cape Breton Centre, and Glace Bay. It gained the area on the north side of East Bay along highway 216 to include Eskasoni First Nation. In 2013, following the recommendations of the 2012 Electoral Boundaries Commission, the district was renamed Sydney River-Mira-Louisbourg. It gained the Mira Road, Sydney River, Prime Brook, and Coxheath areas from Cape Breton South, as well as a section of Grand Lake Road from Cape Breton Nova. It lost the area northwest of East Bay to Victoria-The Lakes and the area southwest of Portage and Sandfield and west of the Mira River to Cape Breton-Richmond. ==Members of the Legislative Assembly== This riding has elected the following Members of the Legislative Assembly: {| border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 |- bgcolor="CCCCCC" !
