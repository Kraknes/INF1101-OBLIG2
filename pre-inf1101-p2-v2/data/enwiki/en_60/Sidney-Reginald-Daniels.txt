The first occasion was at a by-election in March 1929, where he only just managed to hang on to second place. This was at the time that the Liberal party was experiencing something of a revival under the leadership of David Lloyd George. Just two months later he stood again at the General Election, where he again finished second. His next contest was at the 1931 elections. This proved a difficult campaign as a National Government had been formed. Many Liberal candidates in Conservative held seats chose not to run against their partners in the National Government. This did not happen at Bath but the Liberal party nationally fought a weak campaign. His last election campaign was fought under more normal circumstances as by now, the Liberal party had left the National government which had become Conservative in all but name. The result in Bath was an improvement as a consequence. He did not stand for parliament again.British parliamentary election results 1818-1949, Craig, F. W. S. He was Deputy Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Proportional Representation Society.http://www.ukwhoswho.com Daniels is an interesting example of a loyal Liberal politician who by being in India, had not experienced the divisions in the party between Lloyd George and Asquith. In the 1930s, during a period in which many Liberals either dropped out of active politics or left the party for another, Daniels kept going without personal reward. ==References== Category:1873 births Category:1937 deaths Category:British Sanskrit scholars Category:Liberal Party (UK) parliamentary candidates
