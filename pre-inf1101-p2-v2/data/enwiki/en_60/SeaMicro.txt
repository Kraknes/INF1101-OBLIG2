In 2013, SeaMicro AMD collaborated with Verizon Communications to power their new cloud services.https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/10/07/seamicro_claims_verizon_cloud_underlay/ It has powered Verizon to introduce fine-grained server configuration options that allow for more flexibility in instance-sizing by letting administrators select a processor speed between 500 MHz and 2 GHz and scale DRAM up and down in 512 MB increments. ==Products== The first product from SeaMicro was the SM10000, along with the SM10000-XE, which achieved Red Hat Certification in 2011 when operating on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/26/idUS107632+26-Jun-2012+MW20120626 A more recent model, The SeaMicro SM15000 is also designed to support Citrix Xen Servers, VMware ESXi software and both GNU-Linux and Microsoft Windows Operating systems. Specifications of newer versions have reached computing benchmarks of 5 petabytes of storage, 64 CPUs, a 1,000 Virtual machine capacity, and 1.28 Tb/s of bandwidth.http://www.seamicro.com/sites/default/files/AMD%20SeaMicro%20Overview.pdfhttp://seamicro.com/sites/default/files/RedHat.pdf In addition, the 10U Rack Unit provides a total 2,048 CPU cores, 16 TBs of RAM and data is transferred through a custom "Freedom Fabric" for supercomputers unique to SeaMicro microservers.https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/09/11/amd_seamicro_microserver_upgrade_storage/http://seamicro.com/sites/default/files/SM_TO01_64_v2.7.pdf ==Awards== * GigaOM: GreenNet 2011: 10 Big Ideas Winnershttp://www.seamicro.com/node/182 * Silicon Valley/ San Jose Journal: Best Emerging Cleantech Company 2011http://www.seamicro.com/node/184 * 2011 Best Electronic Design Winners: Computer Categoryhttp://electronicdesign.com/article/news/Electronic-Design- Announces-2011-Best-Electronic-Design-Award-Winners-.aspx * Platts: 2011 Rising Star awardhttp://geaweb.platts.com/Winners.aspx?xmlFile=Winners2011.xml * 2014 Silver Edison Awardhttps://www.amd.com/en-us/press-releases/Pages/amds- revolutionary-2014may01.aspx ==References== ==External links== * * Architectural tradeoffs in the Sea Micro SM 10000 Server - Talk given at Stanford University by SeaMicro founder & CTO, Gary Lauterbach.
