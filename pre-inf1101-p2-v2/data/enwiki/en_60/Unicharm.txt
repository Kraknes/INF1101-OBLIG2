Takahara's family operated a paper manufacturing business in Shikoku. After resigning in 1961 from his father's paper manufacturing company, he founded his own, Taisei Kako (Taisei Chemical Works). He then turned his attention to the manufacture and sale of selling wood wool cement board. Then the company in 1963 ventured to manufacture and sell sanitary napkins. The company then started selling tampons in 1974, when Unicharm Corporation was founded to separate the feminine care production from the main company. ==Operations== The company has a number of prominent brands in its portfolio, including MamyPoko, Charm, Moony, BabyJoy, Babylove, Sofy and Lifree, Teemo. In December 2011, Unicharm acquired 51% ownership of pet products maker Hartz Mountain Corporation from Sumitomo Corporation. ==References== ==External links== * * Unicharm Global Website * Unicharm MENA Website Category:Manufacturing companies based in Tokyo Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1961 Category:1961 establishments in Japan Category:Companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Category:Chemical companies based in Tokyo Category:Pulp and paper companies of Japan Category:Personal care companies Category:Mitsubishi Category:Japanese brands
