There are many stories about the origin of the name of the barangay that circulated through word of mouth of Tobog natives wayback Spanish colonization. The most popular, and probably the most interesting fact is that it came from the tree called "Tobog-Tobog" which abounds the place from long time ago. These trees are still visible in the place. == Religion == Toboguenos are mostly Roman Catholics. Others include Jehovah's Witnesses (saksi) and others. The Catholic mass is being celebrated every Sunday throughout the year in the barangay chapel. The chapel is managed by the Tobog Pastoral Council headed by Natividad Ricasio. The patron saint of the barangay is Saint Roch or San Roque. == Government == Barangay and SK Officials are elected every three years. 10% of the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) of the barangay are given to the Sangguniang Kabataan to fund their projects on sports and youth development. However, the SK election didn't push through because President Benigno Aquino III signed the resolution on the postponement of the SK election which is the first step for the total abolishment of the Sangguniang Kabataan as part of the local barangay unit.
