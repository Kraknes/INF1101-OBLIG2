Rotary Racer is a Greenpower team which began in 2005 as an initiative within Chipping Sodbury School to try to get 'Lads and Dads' working together on a project to build and race their own electric racing cars. The team has grown, with 9 different cars being built in the past 9 years. The team is made up of both girls and boys, ranging between the ages of 11 and 18.
