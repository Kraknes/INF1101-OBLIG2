"The Monster" is a song from American rapper Eminem's album The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013) featuring Barbadian singer Rihanna and guest vocals by Bebe Rexha. The song was written by Bebe Rexha, Jon Bellion, and AKS from Prosper, with production handled by Frequency. "The Monster" marks the fourth collaboration between Eminem and Rihanna, following "Love the Way You Lie" (2010), its sequel "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" (2010), and "Numb" (2012). "The Monster" was released on October 29, 2013, as the fourth single from the album. The lyrics describe Rihanna coming to grips with her inner demons while Eminem ponders the negative effects of his fame. Upon release, the song was met with positive reviews from music critics, who compared the song to "Love the Way You Lie". "The Monster" has successfully charted worldwide, topping the charts in twelve countries including Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States' Billboard Hot 100. It also marks Eminem's first number one on the US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart and has reached the top ten in Austria, Belgium, Italy and Spain. The song's accompanying music video was directed by the American filmmaker Rich Lee. The video depicts Rihanna as Eminem's therapist in a session, as previous videos from his career are shown and referenced including "Mockingbird", "My Name Is", "Lose Yourself", "3 a.m.", "The Way I Am" and the 2001 Grammy Awards performance of "Stan" with Elton John. The video was well received and was nominated for several awards. Eminem and Rihanna performed the song live at the 2014 MTV Movie Awards. ==Background and production== The song, "Monster Under My Bed," written by Bebe Rexha, was originally intended to be used on her own debut album. The chorus was later used for "The Monster" In 2010, Eminem and Rihanna released their first official collaboration titled "Love the Way You Lie". The song received both critical and commercial success and topped the US Billboard Hot 100 chart for seven consecutive weeks. By the end of the year, 854,000 copies of the song were sold in the UK, making "Love the Way You Lie" the country's biggest-selling song of 2010. The same year, a sequel to the single, titled "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" was released as part of Rihanna's fifth studio album Loud; it mainly views matters from the female protagonist perspective. In November 2012, Eminem and Rihanna collaborated again on "Numb", which was included on Rihanna's seventh album Unapologetic. In November 2012, singer Bebe Rexha was at Stadium Red studio in Harlem, New York working on material to be included in her debut album. During the sessions Rexha stated that she "was in a really dark place, a dark head space. Figuring out where you are in life and trying to make shit work for yourself--it gets to you. You get super down on yourself. I was just trying to get out of a depressed phase." At that moment, she wrote the hook for "The Monster"; in the moment she wrote it she knew that it was going to be a song performed by Eminem. The singer further stated that she got the inspiration from the quote "about the monsters that are around us and that live inside of us"; additionally, Rexha was disappointed at being dropped from the Island Def Jam record label. The Senior Director of A&R; for Shady Records, Riggs Morales started looking for potential songs to be included on Eminem's eighth studio album. When the producer of "The Monster", Frequency played the song for Morales he "freaked out" and asked for the verses to be stripped and ProTools sessions to be sent to Eminem. When Eminem heard the demo he then added his own verses and adjusted the instrumental portion(s) of the track. However, he left the background vocals sung by Rexha intact. On September 11, 2013, Rihanna wrote on her Twitter account that she had recorded a "#monster" hook for one of her favorite artists. On October 22, Eminem revealed the track listing for his eighth studio album, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, including "The Monster" on which Rihanna was credited as a featured artist. Shortly after premiering the song, Eminem spoke of working with Rihanna again to MTV News: "The perception of the record, what it's saying, I thought it would be a good idea to have her on it because I think people look at us like we're both a little nuts. That's one of the things that I was telling her in making the record: I think that people look at us a little crazy." ==Critical reception== The song was generally well received by critics. Writing for the IBTimes, Tarun Mazumdar reacted positively to it, praising its "memorable lines" and Rihanna's "soulful" vocals and rating it 3.5 out of 5. Amy Sciaretto of PopCrush gave it the same rating and noted that "it's not nearly as powerful or affective as the previous partnership, but it's not supposed to be." Allan Raible of ABC News also enjoyed the song, calling it "a career highlight" and a "personal rhyme about his history." About.com's Bill Lamb had similar thoughts, opining that Eminem's introspection "lends the song engaging power" while also praising Rihanna's vocals. Idolator's Mike Wass noted that while it did not meet the standard of the duo's previous collaboration, the song was still "undeniably catchy and hook-filled enough for top 40 radio success." Keith Murphy of Vibe praised the lyrical content of the song but otherwise found the single lacklustre. Jim Farber of The New York Daily News found it inferior to Eminem's previous single, "Rap God" and too similar to "Love the Way You Lie", but appreciated that "at least Em gets off some good lines in the new song." XXL positioned it at number 19 on their list of the best songs of 2013. Atlanta Black Star described the song as sounding "like an old school rap song as it blends genres with Eminem's rap vocals, rock guitars, and Rihanna's pop-style singing of the chorus." ==Commercial performance== With "The Monster" becoming Rihanna's 13th number one on the Billboard Hot 100, she tied Michael Jackson for the fourth most number ones in the chart's history, as well as becoming the fastest solo artist to accumulate thirteen number ones, surpassing Mariah Carey's record. "The Monster" first entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number three, on November 6, 2013, marking Eminem's third best entry following "Not Afraid" (No. 1, 2010) and "Love the Way You Lie" also featuring Rihanna (No. 2, 2010). This ties "Berzerk", which also debuted at number three on the Hot 100. The entry gave Rihanna her 25th top ten on the chart, equalling Elvis Presley for the eighth-most top tens in the chart's history.

In the same issue, "The Monster" debuted atop the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart, marking Eminem's first number one on the chart of his career, and Rihanna's third. Furthermore, the song entered at number one on the US Rap Songs chart, marking the sixth and fourth leaders for Eminem and Rihanna, respectively. The song topped the Hot 100 in its sixth week on the chart, after previously spending four consecutive weeks at number two. The song's ascent to number one marked Rihanna's 13th US number one, tying her with Michael Jackson for the fourth most number ones in the chart's 55-year history. Additionally, Rihanna became the fastest solo artist to achieve 13 chart-toppers, surpassing the previous record held by Mariah Carey (seven- years, eight-month and 19 days), with only The Beatles reaching 13 number ones more quickly. The song also rose to number one on the Billboard Radio Songs chart, marking Rihanna's twelfth and Eminem's third number one on the chart. Rihanna also passes Mariah Carey for the most number ones on the Radio Songs chart with the single's number one peak. For Eminem, he ties P. Diddy and Ludacris for the most Hot 100 number ones among rappers, with five each. The song has sold 3,844,000 digital copies in the US as of June 2015.

In the United Kingdom, "The Monster" entered at number one on the UK Singles Chart on November 3, 2013 -- for the week ending date November 9, 2013 -- selling 74,674 copies, despite being released on the previous Tuesday, and having a 48-hour disadvantage on the rest of the week's new singles.
