The Song of the Yue Boatman () is a short song in an unknown language of southern China said to have been recorded around 528 BC. A transcription using Chinese characters, together with a Chinese version, is preserved in the Garden of Stories compiled by Liu Xiang five centuries later. The song appears in a story within a story in the Shanshuo () chapter of the Garden of Stories. A minister of the state of Chu relates an incident in which the 6th-century BC prince Zixi (Zi Xi ), the Lord of E (E ), on an excursion on his state barge, was intrigued by the singing of his Yue boatman, and asked for an interpreter to translate it. It was a song of praise of the rural life, expressing the boatman's secret pleasure at knowing the prince: :{| |- ! align="left" colspan="2" | Chinese version of the song |- ! align="left" | Text !! align="left" | English translation |- | Jin Xi He Xi Xi , || Oh! What night is tonight, |- | Qian Zhou Zhong Liu . || we are rowing on the river. |- | Jin Ri He Ri Xi , || Oh! What day is today, |- | De Yu Wang Zi Tong Zhou .  || I get to share a boat with a prince. |- | Meng Xiu Bei Hao Xi , || The prince's kindness makes me shy, |- | Bu Zi Gou Chi .  || I take no notice of the people's mocking cries. |- | Xin Ji Wan Er Bu Jue Xi , || Ignorant, but not uncared for, |- | De Zhi Wang Zi .  || I make acquaintance with a prince. |- | Shan You Mu Xi Mu You Zhi , || There are trees in the mountains and there are branches on the trees, |- | Xin Yue Jun Xi Jun Bu Zhi .  || I adore you, oh! You do not know. |} On hearing this, the prince embraced the boatman and gave him his decorated cloak. The words of the original song were transcribed in 32 Chinese characters, each representing the sound of a foreign syllable: :Lan Xi Bian Cao Lan Yu Chang Hu Ze Yu Chang Zhou Zhou Zhou Yan Hu Qin Xu Xu Man Yu Hu Zhao Chan Qin Yu Shen Ti Sui He Hu  As with the similarly recorded Pai-lang songs, interpretation is complicated by uncertainty about the sounds of Old Chinese represented by the characters. In 1981, the linguist Wei Qingwen proposed an interpretation by comparing the words of the song with several Tai languages, particularly Zhuang varieties spoken today in Guangxi province. Building on Wei's work, Zhengzhang Shangfang produced a version in written Thai (dating from the late 13th century) as the closest available approximation to the original language, using his own reconstruction of Old Chinese. Both Wei's and Zhengzhang's interpretations correspond loosely to the original 54-character Chinese rendition, and lack counterparts of the third and ninth lines of the Chinese version. Zhengzhang suggests that these lines were added during the composition of the Chinese version to fit the Chu Ci poetic style. Zhengzhang's interpretation remains controversial, both because of the gap of nearly two millennia between the date of the song and written Thai and because Thai belongs to the more geographically distant Southwestern Tai languages. Qin Xiaohang has argued that although the transcription does not represent a true writing system for the non-Chinese language, such transcription practice formed the basis of the later development of the Sawndip script for Zhuang. == Notes == == References == == External links == * Shuoyuan 11.13, CText project.
