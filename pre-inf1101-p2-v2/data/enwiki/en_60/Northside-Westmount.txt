Northside-Westmount is a provincial electoral district in Nova Scotia, Canada, that elects one member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. In 1933, the County of Cape Breton was divided into five electoral districts, one of which was Cape Breton North, which was carved out of parts of Cape Breton Centre and Cape Breton East. In 2003, the district gained upper North Sydney as far as Balls Creek and Point Aconi. In 2013, the district was renamed Northside- Westmount and it lost the area west of Little Bras d'Or to Victoria-The Lakes and gained the area north of Highway 125 from Cape Breton South.Northside- Westmount - Constituency History Nova Scotia Legislature ==Members of the Legislative Assembly== This riding has elected the following Members of the Legislative Assembly: {| border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 |- bgcolor="CCCCCC" !
