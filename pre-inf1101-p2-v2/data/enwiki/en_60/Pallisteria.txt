"Pallisteria" is an extinct genus of "rauisuchian" that is yet to be formally described. Thus, the name is considered a nomen nudum. It is known from NHMUK R36620, a partial skull and some postcranial fragments collected from the Lifua Member of the Manda Formation of Tanzania and date back to the late Anisian stage of the Middle Triassic. The remains were first mentioned without description by English paleontologist Alan J. Charig in 1967 who published the name "Pallisteria angustimentum", along with Nyasasaurus in a review of the Archosauria. Charig referred "Pallisteria" to the Thecodontia.Charig, A. J. (1967).
