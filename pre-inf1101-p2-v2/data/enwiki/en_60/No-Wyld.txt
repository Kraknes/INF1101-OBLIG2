No Wyld (formerly known as The Wyld) is a New Zealand alternative hip hop band, formed in 2010. ==History== Mo and Joe met while studying architecture at university in 2007. They joined Brandon two years later through Mo's older brother Moomin Kheir. They began covering tracks they liked, and performing at open mic nights. "Revolution" was the first single that attracted attention online. The track earned praise from MTV Iggy in the United States and was subsequently included in United States TV show 90210. The band attracted the interest of major sponsors like Red Bull, who included them in a major campaign. In August 2013 they began recording their first EP, Abstract, at Red Bull Studios. The Wyld relocated to the United States where Band Manager, Michelle Bakker secured a recording contract with Columbia records in 2013 and then a Publishing deal with Sony ATV in April 2014. The track "Odyssey" was used in a commercial for McDonald's during Sochi 2014 secured by Band Manager Michelle Bakker, and later included in the soundtrack for NHL 15, Madden NFL 16 and Need for Speed. "Odyssey" was also featured in the pregame video played before the West Virginia University Mountaineers football team took the field for home games during the 2015 season. In addition, "Let Me Know" was included in the soundtrack for FIFA 16. This song also appeared in EA Sports game, FIFA 17 with "Justfayu" featuring KAMAU and their song "Air" was used as the official theme song for the WWE's Elimination Chamber event in 2017. ==Band members== * Mohamed "Mo" Kheir - Vocals (2010-present) * Brandon Black - Vocals, Production (2010-present) * Joseph Pascoe - Guitar, Production (2010-present) ==Discography== === Studio albums === {| class="wikitable plainrowheaders" style="text-align:center;" border="1" ! scope="col" rowspan="2" style="width:12em;"| Title ! scope="col" rowspan="2" style="width:18em;"| Album details ! scope="col" colspan="1"| Peak chart positions ! scope="col" rowspan="2"| Certifications ! scope="col" rowspan="2" style="width:12em;"| Sales |- ! scope="col" style="width:3em;font-size:90%;"| NZ |- ! scope="row" | Preface | * Released: 29 June 2012 * Label: Dryden Street * Format: CD, download | 36 | | |- ! scope="row" | Nomads | * Released: 25 November 2016 * Label: Columbia * Format: download | | | |} === Extended plays === {| class="wikitable plainrowheaders" style="text-align:center;" |- ! scope="col" style="width:12em;"| Title ! scope="col" style="width:18em;"| Album details |- ! scope="row" | Abstract | * Released: 29 October 2013 * Label: Fontana North * Format: CD, download |- ! scope="row" | Ascension | * Released: 9 October 2015 * Label: Columbia Records * Format: CD, download |} === Singles === ==== As lead artist ==== {| class="wikitable plainrowheaders" style="text-align:center;" ! scope="col" rowspan="2" style="width:18em;"| Title ! scope="col" rowspan="2"| Year ! scope="col" colspan="1"| Peak chart positions ! scope="col" rowspan="2" style="width:12em;"| Certifications ! scope="col" rowspan="2"| Album |- ! scope="col" style="width:3em;font- size:90%;"| NZ |- ! scope="row"| "Revolution" | 2011 | style="text-align:center;"| - | | rowspan="3"| Preface |- ! scope="row"| "Full Circle" | rowspan="2"| 2012 | style="text-align:center;"| - | |- ! scope="row"| "Rome" | style="text- align:center;"| - | |- ! scope="row"| "Odyssey" | 2013 | style="text- align:center;"| - | | Abstract Ascension |- ! scope="row"| "Queen" (featuring KAMAU) | rowspan="3"| 2015 | style="text-align:center;"| - | | Ascension |- ! scope="row"| "Let Me Know" | style="text-align:center;"| - | | Ascension Nomads |- ! scope="row"| "Afraid" | style="text-align:center;"| - | | |- ! scope="row"| "Paranoid" | rowspan="4"| 2016 | style="text- align:center;"| - | | rowspan="4"| Nomads |- ! scope="row"| "Tomorrow" (featuring Allan Kingdom) | style="text-align:center;"| - |- ! scope="row"| "Grown Up" | style="text-align:center;"| - |- ! scope="row"| "Gone" | style="text-align:center;"| - |- ! colspan="5"| "--" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. |} ==== As featured artist ==== {| class="wikitable plainrowheaders" style="text-align:center;" ! scope="col" rowspan="2" style="width:18em;" | Title ! scope="col" rowspan="2" | Year ! scope="col" colspan="1" | Peak chart positions ! scope="col" rowspan="2" style="width:12em;" | Certifications ! scope="col" rowspan="2" | Album |- ! scope="col" style="width:3em;font-size:90%;"| NZ |- ! scope="row"| "Jusfayu" (KAMAU featuring No Wyld) | rowspan="1"| 2015 | style="text-align:center;"| - | | rowspan="1" | A Gorgeous Fortune EP |- |} === Music videos === {| class="wikitable plainrowheaders" style="text-align:center;" ! scope="col" style="width:16em;" | Title ! scope="col" | Year ! scope="col" | Director(s) |- !scope="row"| "Revolution" | rowspan="1"| 2011 | rowspan="1"| No Wyld & Joe Rixon |- !scope="row"| "Full Circle" | rowspan="2"| 2012 | rowspan="1"| Claire Littler |- !scope="row"| "Rome" | rowspan="1"| Moomin Kheir |- !scope="row"| "Odyssey" | rowspan="1"| 2015 | rowspan="1"| No Wyld |} ==References== Category:New Zealand rock music groups
