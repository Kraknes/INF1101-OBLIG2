Pierre-Joseph Candeille (8 December 1744 - 24 April 1827) was a French composer and singer, born in Estaires. He studied at Lille before moving to Paris, where he worked singing basse-taille in the chorus of the Opera and the Concert Spirituel between 1767 and 1781, except for a brief period (1771--1773) he spent in Moulins. From 1784, he became a full-time composer. He worked at the Opera as choirmaster from 1800 to 1802 and again from 1804 to 1805, before retiring to live in Chantilly.Rushton in Grove Candeille wrote four symphonies, as well as ballets, divertissements and sacred music (including a mass and a Magnificat). None of his operas achieved much success, with the exception of his revision of Jean-Philippe Rameau's Castor et Pollux.Van Boer, p. 112 Candeille's version was premiered at the Paris Opera on 14 June 1791. By 1 January 1793, it had had 50 performances. It continued to be one of the most popular operatic works in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic period and was last staged in 1817. Candeille retained much of Rameau's original music, including "almost all the dances."Darlow pp. 221-225 Candeille was the father of the composer, singer and actor Amelie-Julie Candeille. ==Works== ===Staged works=== All information from Julian Rushton in Grove. {| class="wikitable sortable" !|Title!!|Genre!!|Subdivisions!!|Libretto!!|Premiere date!!|Theatre |- |Les curieux indiscrets|| divertissement || || Jean-Georges Noverre || 1778|| Comedie-Francaise |- |Deux comtesses || divertissement || || Jean- Georges Noverre || 1778 || Comedie-Francaise |- |La provencale New music for an opera by Jean-Joseph Mouret || sung ballet || 1 entree || Joseph de La Font || 8 November 1778 || Paris Opera |- |Laure et Petrarque || pastorale-heroique || 1 act || Pierre-Louis Moline || 1778 (revised 1780) || Marly; revised version, Paris Opera |- |Pizarre, ou La conquete de Perou || tragedie lyrique || 5 acts || Pierre Duplessis || 3 May 1785 || Paris Opera |- |Castor et Pollux (revision of Rameau's opera) Revised version of Castor et Pollux (1737; rev. 1754) by Jean-Philippe Rameau || tragedie lyrique || 5 acts || Pierre- Joseph Bernard || 14 June 1791 || Paris Opera |- |La patrie reconnaissante, ou L'apotheose de Beaurepaire || opera || 1 act || Leboeuf || 3 February 1793 || Paris Opera |- |} ===Unperformed works=== *Les fetes lupercales (pastorale- heroique), 1777 *L'Amour et Psyche, Bacchus et Erigone, 1780 (proposed revision of two entrees of Mondonville's Les fetes de Paphos) *Themire (opera), c.1781 *Lausus et Lydie (opera), 1786 *Les jeux olympiques (opera), 1788 *Ladislas et Adelaide (opera), 1791 *Roxane et Statira, ou Les veuves d'Alexandre (tragedie lyrique), c.1792 *Brutus (opera), 1793 *Danae (opera), c.1796 *Tithon et l'Aurore (opera), c.1796 *Ragonde (pastorale-heroique), c.1798 *Pithys (pastorale-heroique) ==References== ==Sources== *Beril H.
