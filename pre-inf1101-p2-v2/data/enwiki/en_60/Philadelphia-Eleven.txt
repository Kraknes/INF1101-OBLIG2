The Philadelphia Eleven are eleven women who were the first women ordained as priests in the Episcopal Church on July 29, 1974, two years before General Convention affirmed and explicitly authorized the ordination of women to the priesthood. ==Background== In the Episcopal Church in the United States, a member church of the worldwide Anglican Communion, no canon law existed prohibiting the ordination of women as deacons, priests and bishops.Womanpriest, Bozarth-Campbell, first edition, Paulist Press (1978), pp. 105-109,114-115 However, the custom of ordaining only men was the norm. Women ordained as deacons were subject to a canon law which referred to them as "deaconesses". Although they were understood by themselves and their bishops as being in holy orders,Bozarth-Campbell (1978), pp.77,85-87 they were treated differently from their male counterparts who were simply called deacons. By custom they were celibate and wore a blue habit-like garb which gave them the appearance of nuns, though they were not nuns.Hein & Shattuck (2004), p. 98 By custom women were denied ordination to the priesthood. During the first half of the twentieth century women in the Episcopal Church had begun exploring ways to increase their participation in the life of the church. Many women became church workers or directors of religious education.Hein & Shattuck (2004), p. 128 The movement gained explicit momentum in 1970 when laywomen were seated with voice and vote for the first time in General Convention, the bicameral legislative body of the Episcopal Church, and called for a vote to eliminate the canon law on "Deaconesses" so that male and female deacons would be treated equally.Bozarth-Campbell (1978), pp.109-112 In 1965, James Pike, Bishop of California, recognized Phyllis Edwards as a deacon in his diocese.Sumner (1987), pp. 16-17 She had been ordained a year earlier under the old canon law using the term "deaconess". This increased awareness led to the General Convention of 1970 eliminating canonical distinctions between male deacons and female deaconesses, allowing women already ordained to marry for the first time and to discard the old habits. It made clear that women seeking ordination would be recognized as full and equal deacons. The Episcopal Church was then presented with the issue of whether to ordain women as priests and bishops too. A resolution was put forward by the women deputies at the 1970 General Convention to approve women's ordination to the priesthood and episcopate. It failed to pass the House of Deputies, but nonetheless had much positive support.Sumner (1987), p. 19 The Anglican Consultative Council met for the first time in 1971 and considered the issue of women's ordination to the priesthood on a communion- wide level, resolving that women should be allowed to be ordained priests under certain local conditions."Church News Briefs" (1971) Thus in an effort to prepare for the next General Convention in 1973, a group of female professional church workers, deaconesses, female seminarians, and their supporters met in 1971 to form the Episcopal Women's Caucus, a national coalition to plan future advocacy work for women's ordination.Prichard (1999), pp. 256-7 However, when similar legislation failed to pass at the 1973 General Convention because of a parliamentary technicality,General Convention allows for controversial votes in the House of Deputies to be done by orders. This means that each diocesan delegation of four clergy deputies and four lay deputies is divided into its lay and clerical parts whose votes are counted separately. For the vote in either of the two orders to be counted as affirmative, at least three of the four deputies in that order must vote for the resolution. A divided vote (2-2) is counted as negative. The vote for women's ordination in the clerical order of the House of Deputies was 50 dioceses "yes", 43 "no", and 20 divided; in the lay order it was 49 dioceses "yes", 37 "no", and 26 divided. Because each divided vote represented a negative vote, the motion was defeated. Hein & Shattuck (2004), pp. 140, 156 note 26 some of the women began to plan new strategies, feeling that they could not wait another three years for women's priesthood to be legislatively approved. Suzanne Hiatt, a deacon, stated a shared sentiment among these women that their "vocation was not to continue to ask for permission to be a priest, but to be a priest."Hein & Shattuck (2004), p. 140 In November 1973, several women who were deacons met with bishops who supported their cause, only to find them unwilling to ordain women to the priesthood until General Convention had settled the issue. On December 15, 1973, when five women ordained as deacons presented themselves at a priestly ordination service in New York, Paul Moore, Jr., Bishop of New York, allowed them to participate but declined to lay hands on their heads at the moment of ordination.The five deacons were Carol Anderson, Emily Hewitt, Carter Heyward, Barbara Schlachter and Julia Sibley. Sumner (1987), pp. 21-22. Marie Moorefield had also planned to join in presenting herself for ordination but was ill. McDaniel (2011), p. 49 note 34 The women and a large part of the congregation walked out of the service in protest.Sumner (1987), p. 22 By July 1974, as supporters of women's ordination to the priesthood grew restless, three retired bishops stepped forward and agreed to ordain a group of qualified women deacons. The bishops were: Daniel Corrigan, retired bishop suffragan of Colorado; Robert L. DeWitt, recently resigned Bishop of Pennsylvania; and Edward R. Welles, retired Bishop of West Missouri, Hein & Shattuck (2004), p. 141"Bishops Urged to Reconsider Ordination Plans" (1974) Eleven women who were deacons presented themselves as ready for ordination to the priesthood, and plans for the service proceeded. The women who became known as the "Philadelphia Eleven" (or "Philadelphia 11")Hein & Shattuck (2004), p. 142 were Merrill Bittner, Alla Bozarth- Campbell, Alison Cheek, Emily Hewitt, Carter Heyward, Suzanne Hiatt, Marie Moorefield, Jeannette Piccard, Betty Bone Schiess, Katrina Swanson, and Nancy Wittig.Sumner (1987), p. 23 ==Ordination service== Ordination service at the Church of the Advocate The ordination service was held on Monday, July 29, 1974, the Feast of Saints Mary and Martha, at the Church of the Advocate in Philadelphia, where Suzanne Hiatt served as deacon, and whose rector was civil rights advocate Paul Washington. Beginning at 11 o'clock in the morning, the service lasted for three hours.Blau (1974) The eleven women serving as deacons presented themselves to Bishops Corrigan, DeWitt, and Welles, who ordained them as priests. Harvard University professor Charles V. Willie, who was also the vice president of the House of Deputies at the time, preached a sermon entitled, "The Priesthood of All Believers," which began, "The hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship God in spirit and in truth,"John 4:23 followed by Dr. Willie's declaration that "as blacks refused to participate in their own oppression by going to the back of the bus in 1955 in Montgomery, women are refusing to cooperate in their own oppression by remaining on the periphery of full participation in the Church."Bozarth- Campbell (1978), pp. 130-9 The crowd numbered almost two thousand supporters and a few protesters. In the middle of the service when Corrigan said, "If there be any of you who knoweth any impediment or notable crime (in these women), let him come forth in the name of God..." several priests in attendance proceeded to read statements against the ordination. Once these statements had been made, the bishops responded that they were acting in obedience to God, noting that "hearing God's command, we can heed no other. The time for our obedience is now." And they proceeded with the ordinations. Jose Ramos, Bishop of Costa Rica, was also present at the service but did not participate in the act of ordination due to his young and active episcopate. Barbara C. Harris, who was senior warden at Church of the Advocate and would later become the first woman ordained bishop in the Episcopal Church on February 11, 1989, served as crucifer for the serviceMcDaniel (2011), p. 57Hein & Shattuck (2004), pp. 142-3 Patricia Merchant Park, one of the leaders of the Episcopal Women's CaucusSumner (1987), p. 13 and the second woman to be regularly ordained as a priest in 1977 after General Convention had given its endorsement, served as deacon.McDaniel (2011), pp. 57, 85 An iconic photo of the service was published on July 30 in the Philadelphia Inquirer and picked up worldwide. ==Aftermath== Two weeks after the ordination service had taken place, on August 14-15, Presiding Bishop John Allin convened an emergency meeting of the House of Bishops at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago.McDaniel (2011), p. 58 At first, the House declared the priestly ordinations of the eleven women to be invalid, stating that "we express our conviction that the necessary conditions for ordination to the priesthood in the Episcopal Church were not fulfilled on the occasion in question, since we are convinced that a bishop's authority to ordain can be effectively exercised only in and for a community which has authorized him to act for them..."Sumner (1987), p. 24 Then Arthur A. Vogel, Bishop of West Missouri, raised his objection. He was considered the most theologically astute of the bishops, and told his colleagues that they had no theological grounds for declaring the ordinations invalid because they were performed by bishops in good standing according to the Ordination Rite in the Book of Common Prayer and by laying- on-of-hands within the Apostolic Succession. To declare the ordinations invalid would be to flout hundreds of years of orthodox definition for the criteria of valid ordination. The House of Bishops listened and changed its position, declaring the women irregularly ordained instead. The irregularity involved was one of protocol. The women had completed the normal pre- ordination process of theological education, examinations and meetings with their bishops and diocesan representatives, and most had gained the necessary signed lay and clergy testimonials vouching for their character and preparation, but their local standing committees were timid about aftermath and refused to give their endorsement. This was the detail in every case and the one breach of canon law requirement that could qualify their be regarded as irregularly ordained priests. Through no fault or lack of effort of their own, they were unable to fulfill a canonically required point of protocol. Despite their anger, the bishops listened to Vogel, a highly respected theologian, and they conceded the point. The bishops also admonished Episcopalians not to recognize any of the eleven women as priests until the next General Convention could decide on their ecclesiastical status. When the House of Bishops met again at its regularly-scheduled meeting in October in Oaxtepec, Mexico, however, the body endorsed "in principle" the ordination of women to the priesthood, which it had assented to as well at its meeting in New Orleans in 1972.Sumner (1987), pp. 21, 24 This was in no way an overturning of its decision that the priestly ordinations of the Eleven had been irregular, and the body further urged its bishops to refrain from ordaining more women to the priesthood "unless and until such activities have been approved by the General Convention" meeting in 1976. Meanwhile, three of the first women to become priests took opportunities to celebrate the Eucharist against orders from their bishops. Alison Cheek, Jeannette Piccard and Carter Heyward celebrated communion together at an ecumenical service at Riverside Church in New York City on Reformation Sunday, October 27, 1974.McDaniel (2011), p. 64 A couple of weeks later on Sunday, November 10, 1974, Alison Cheek celebrated the Eucharist at St. Stephen and the Incarnation Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C. This first public celebration of the Eucharist in the Episcopal Church by a priest who was a woman was permitted by the church's rector, William Wendt.McDaniel (2011), p. 65 The following month, Alison Cheek and Carter Heyward were invited to celebrate the Eucharist on Sunday, December 8, at Christ Episcopal Church in Oberlin, Ohio, by the rector, Peter Beebe."History of Christ Episcopal Church," Electronic Oberlin Group These events didn't go unnoticed by the larger church, and in the summer of 1975 both Wendt and Beebe were brought to ecclesiastical trial by their dioceses and convicted of disobeying a "godly admonition" from their bishops against permitting the women to celebrate the Eucharist. Not all Episcopal Church institutions were against the priestly ordinations or the women, however, and in January 1975 the trustees of the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, offered faculty appointments with full priestly duties to Suzanne Hiatt and Carter Heyward. Both women began celebrating the Eucharist in the seminary chapel in March 1975. In February 1975, advocates of women's ordination to the priesthood and episcopate formed an organization called Women's Ordination Now (WON) to support the Philadelphia Eleven (and later the Washington Four) women as well as the bishops who had ordained them and William Wendt and Peter Beebe. At the 1976 General Convention, WON worked to see that the irregularly-ordained women were fully recognized as priests and allowed to function as priests without any penalties.Armentrout & Slocum (2000), p. 563"Biography," Ann Robb Smith Papers, p. 3 ===Washington Four=== As supporters of women's ordination to the priesthood continued to organize and plan for the 1976 General Convention amid all of this turmoil, the Church was surprised by a second ordination service, this time held in Washington, D.C. On Sunday, September 7, 1975, at St. Stephen and the Incarnation Episcopal Church, George W. Barrett, retired Bishop of Rochester, NY, ordained four more women who were deacons to the priesthood.Sumner (1987), p. 25 The four women were Lee McGee (Street), Alison Palmer, Betty Rosenberg (Powell), and Diane Tickell. They became known as the "Washington Four" (or "Washington 4").McDaniel (2011), p. 75 A fifth woman, Phyllis Edwards, had originally planned on taking part in the ordination but withdrew the week before. Edwards had been recognized as a deacon by James Pike in 1965, creating a corrective precedent for the many women who had been ordained to the diaconate long before who were still being called "deaconesses," and though "The Rev." correctly preceded their names, they were not consistently regarded as members of the clergy."Ordination Services for Four Women Deacons Held" (1975) Over 1,000 people attended the service including the rector William Wendt, Peter Beebe, several of the Philadelphia Eleven priests, and again retired Pennsylvania bishop Robert L. DeWitt."An Unauthorized Ordination Happened in Washington" (1975)McDaniel (2011), p. 74 McGee's husband, Kyle McGee, an Episcopal priest and chaplain at Georgetown University, preached at the service, stating that "today we are engaged in a prophetic act. I pray that our actions will help enable us who are present and the church universal to reexamine our beliefs and practices of priesthood so that we may include all Christians in the ministry of our Lord." Presiding Bishop John Allin again spoke out against this second set of ordinations, declaring that Barrett had defied canon law (without citing what that law might be or where it was prohibited); William Creighton, Bishop of Washington; and "the rights of the entire membership of the Episcopal Church." While noting that such "destructive and divisive acts may be beyond prevention amid this age of confusion and turmoil," he added that "the tragedy is that so much done in good conscience for the sake of renewal can so frequently prevent that needed renewal." While none of the bishops who had participated in the irregular ordinations were called to ecclesiastical trial, they were censured by the House of Bishops and their actions decried.Sumner (1987), pp. 25-6 ===Women's ordination to the priesthood and episcopate approved=== The 1976 General Convention met in Minneapolis on September 15-23, 1976. On September 15, the House of Bishops voted 95 to 61 to change or eliminate ambiguous places in canon law that seemed to prevent the ordination of women to the priesthood, and to clarify matters by creating a canon to affirm the ordination of women as priests and bishops.Sumner (1987), p. 26 Because of the two-house structure of the General Convention, the House of Deputies had to vote on the matter the following day. After much deliberation in that House, the clerical order voted 60 in favor, 39 opposed, and 15 divided, while the laity voted 64 in favor, 36 opposed, and 13 divided.Sumner (1987), p. 27 Women's ordination to the priesthood and episcopacy was approved,Bozarth-Campbell (1978) p. 153 and the vote meant that women who were deacons could be canonically ordained to the priesthood as early as January 1, 1977, by authorization of a specifically affirming canon for that purpose.Sumner (1987), p. 28 Later in the week, on September 21, the House of Bishops voted to require a "conditional ordination" for the fifteen women who had been irregularly ordained, much to the disappointment of the women and their supporters. The next day, however, the bishops reversed their decision and instead, in keeping with the status of "irregular" which they had imposed on the women, they voted to allow the individual diocesan bishops of the Philadelphia Eleven and Washington Four priests to "regularize" them in a form of their own discretion, with the option of a "public event" that would allow the people of their dioceses to welcome and celebrate the priestly ministries of the women. These services were held for the priests beginning in January 1977. The first woman (already a deacon) canonically ordained to the priesthood on January 1, 1977, was Jacqueline A. Means, ordained by Donald J. Davis, Bishop of Erie, in the Episcopal Church of All Saints in Indianapolis. By the end of January 1977 about forty women had been ordained priests and an additional sixty by the end of the year. By 1979 almost 300 women had been ordained to the priesthood, and the total increased to more than 600 by 1985.Sumner (1987), pp. 28, 30 ==Women involved== The eleven women (who were already deacons) who were ordained to the Episcopal priesthood at the Church of the Advocate in Philadelphia on July 29, 1974 and are known as the Philadelphia Eleven are: 1\. Merrill Bittner was born in 1946 in Pasadena, California.Episcopal Clerical Directory 2011 A graduate of Lake Erie College and Bexley Hall Seminary, she was ordained as a deacon on January 6, 1973, in the Diocese of Rochester, where she served at the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd in Webster, New York. She was 27 when she was ordained to the priesthood in 1974. Like many of the other Philadelphia Eleven women, it was hard for her to find support and employment as a priest in the Episcopal Church following her ordination. Instead she worked in prison ministry"News Brief" (1976) and found herself roaming the country in a van working odd jobs before later becoming a career counselor.Shea (1994) In 2001 she reentered parish ministry and has served as a priest at St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Rumford, Maine. 2\. Alla Renee Bozarth (Bozarth-Campbell) was born in Portland, Oregon on May 15, 1947. She earned her B.S.S. (1971) degree at Northwestern University in Interpretation, after which she was ordained deacon and served as staff minister at the Northwestern University congregation of St. Thomas a Becket from 1971 to 1973.Bozarth-Campbell (1978), 92-93 She earned her M.A. (1972) and Ph.D. (1974) degrees at Northwestern University in Interpretation: Hermeneutics, Aesthetics and Performing Arts (School of Speech and Drama). Bozarth was the first woman to be ordained as a deacon in the Diocese of Oregon on September 8, 1971.Bozarth-Campbell (1978), pp. 77-89 Her husband, Philip Ross Campbell (Bozarth-Campbell), was ordained as a deacon in 1973 and as a priest in 1974.Bozarth-Campbell (1978), pp. 89-100 In 1975 Bozarth incorporated Wisdom House, an ecumenical spirituality center, as a 501(c)3 non-profit religious corporation of the State of Minnesota (later the State of Oregon).Bozarth, Alla Renee, Womanpriest: A Personal Odyssey, revised edition, Luramedia 1988, pp.45-63 She served at Wisdom House as priest-in-charge. After her husband's death in 1985, she returned to Sandy, Oregon and moved Wisdom House to her home there. She discontinued travel and public speaking in 1994 but was able to attend the 25th anniversary celebrations in Philadelphia in 1999. In 2004 Bozarth retired from her counseling practice and regular celebrations of the Holy Eucharist at Wisdom House, but she continues to write and offer prayers and poems on meditation blogs, celebrate the Eucharist for special occasions and provide pastoral care when asked, mostly by telephone or mail. Bozarth is a poet and author and has written two books on grief, Life is Goodbye/Life is Hello~ Grieving Well through All Kinds of Loss (1982) and A Journey through Grief (1990) and various meditation and poetry books. Her poem "Transfiguration" was presented to the Mayor of Hiroshima in May, 1980, becoming part of the permanent collection of the Peace Memorial Garden. Bozarth's 10th anniversary poem for the Philadelphia Ordinations, "Passover Remembered," has become an ecumenical touchstone and is broadly used by women and men in leadership in Roman Catholic religious communities and others in various traditions. Bozarth has lectured for the Institute of Women Today in Chicago and several other cities, including Mankato, Minnesota, where she also gave a keynote address with Jean Audrey Powers at the first annual Women and Spirituality Conference in 1981.Bozarth (1988) 3\. Alison Mary Cheek was born in 1927 in Adelaide, South Australia, where she graduated from the University of Adelaide in 1947 and married her economics tutor, Bruce Cheek.Bird (2013) The couple moved to Boston for his fellowship at Harvard University and then back to Australia two years later. They returned to the United States in 1957 when Bruce was hired by the World Bank in Washington, D.C. Cheek had become active as a lay leader at St. Alban's Episcopal Church in Annandale, Virginia, when her rector encouraged her to take some classes at Virginia Theological Seminary because she was increasingly being asked to lead programs at the church.McDaniel (2011), p. 23 She was admitted into the seminary's B.D. program in 1963 with no intention of seeking ordination, but suddenly felt a call to become a priest while on a retreat.McDaniel (2011), p. 24 With four young children at home, her bishop (around that time Robert F. Gibson, Jr. was diocesan Bishop of Virginia and Samuel B. Chilton was the suffragan bishop) dissuaded her from considering ordination, and it took her six years to complete her degree part-time. Following graduation from the seminary, she was hired as a lay minister at Christ Church in Alexandria, where she was in charge of pastoral ministry and allowed to preach a few timesMcDaniel (2011), p. 28 She then began training and working with the Pastoral Counseling and Consulting Centers of Greater Washington and the Washington Institute for Pastoral Psychotherapy, returning to St. Alban's to continue pastoral ministry as a laywomanMcDaniel (2011), p. 29 Eventually, however, her rector encouraged her to enter the ordination process in the Diocese of Virginia, and she was ordained as the first woman ordained deacon in the South on January 29, 1972.McDaniel (2011), p. 33 When the House of Deputies voted against women's ordination in 1973, Cheek was motivated to work with other women and supporters to change the church's mind.McDaniel (2011), p. 34 After the Philadelphia Ordinations, Cheek accepted a number of invitations to celebrate the Eucharist although her priestly ordination had not been approved by the wider church.McDaniel (2011), pp. 64-5 She also became active in marginalized groups such as the gay movement, black movement, and women in poverty, sticking to the margins of the church to exercise her ministry.McDaniel (2011), p. 94 In 1976 Time magazine named her as one of twelve women of the year for her advocacy and action on behalf of women's ordination."National Affairs: A Dozen Who Made a Difference" (1976) She was hired as an assistant priest at St. Stephen and the Incarnation Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., and later Trinity Memorial Church in Philadelphia before going back to school at the Episcopal Divinity School, where she was hired as the Director of Feminist Liberation Studies in 1989 and earned her D.Min. degree in 1990. In 1996 she joined the Greenfire Community and Retreat Center in Tenants Harbor, Maine, where she served as a facilitator, teacher, and counselor, and later became active with St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Rockland. 4\. Emily Clark Hewitt was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1944. After earning a degree from Cornell University in 1966, she served as an administrator of the Cornell/Hofstra Upward Bound Program at the Union Settlement House in East Harlem from 1967-1969."Chief Judge Emily C. Hewitt" Called to ordained ministry in the Episcopal Church, Hewitt was ordained as a deacon on June 3, 1972, in the Diocese of New York, and was supported by St. Mary's Episcopal Church in Manhattanville, New York."History", St. Mary's Episcopal Church Hewitt co-authored the book Women Priests: Yes or No? with fellow Philadelphia Eleven priest Suzanne Hiatt in 1973. While serving as assistant professor of religion and education at Andover Newton Theological School in Newton Centre, Massachusetts, from 1973-1975, she was ordained to the priesthood in Philadelphia at the age of 30 in 1974, and received her M.Phil. degree from Union Theological Seminary the following year. Finding it hard to practice her priesthood in the Episcopal Church, Hewitt continued her education, earning a J.D. from Harvard University in 1978. That same year she began practicing law at the Boston law firm of Hill & Barlow, where she was elected a partner in 1985 and served as chair of the real estate department from 1987-1993. In 1993 she became the General Counsel of the United States General Services Administration, where she served until being commissioned as a judge of the United States Court of Federal Claims by President Clinton in 1998. Hewitt married former U.S. Assistant Attorney General Eleanor D. Acheson in 2004."Class Notes 1960 to 1969" In 2009, President Obama designated Hewitt to serve as Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. 5\. Isabel Carter Heyward was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1945. She earned a B.A. from Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia, in 1967 and then moved to New York to begin a B.D. at Union Theological Seminary.Carter Heyward Papers Finding that she wasn't sure where she stood regarding her involvement in the church, she left Union after a year and moved back home to Charlotte to work at her home parish, St. Martin's Episcopal Church, as a lay assistant, doing all the duties except those reserved for priests. In 1971 she returned to New York and pursued an M.A. in the comparative study of religion at Columbia University before completing an M.Div. back at Union in 1973. She later went on to earn a Ph.D. in systematic theology from Union in 1980. Feeling a call to the priesthood, Heyward was ordained a deacon on June 9, 1973, in the Diocese of New York and ordained to the priesthood in Philadelphia at 29 in 1974. Following this ordination, Heyward and fellow priest Suzanne Hiatt were hired as assistant professors at the Episcopal Divinity School (EDS) in January 1975, where she received tenure in 1981. Heyward's teaching at EDS focused on 19th century Anglican theology, feminist liberation theology, and the theology of sexuality. She has published numerous books on these topics during her tenure, including A Priest Forever, an autobiographical account of her ordination published in 1976. Heyward retired from teaching in 2005 and moved back to North Carolina. 6\. Suzanne Radley Hiatt was born in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1936.Suzanne Hiatt Papers As a child she dreamed of entering the ordained ministry of the church, but dismissed the thought as impossible before feeling a call to ordination again in her twenties. She attended high school in Edina, Minnesota, and then one year of college at Wellesley College before transferring to Radcliffe College, where she earned a bachelor's degree in American history in 1958. After graduation she worked for two years as a Girl Scout professional in Hartford, traveled around Europe, and taught high school. Feeling her call to ordination return, she entered the Episcopal Theological School (ETS), where she received her M.Div. in 1964. She completed an M.S.W. from Boston University the following year and moved back to Minnesota where she worked with the Presbyterian Church in "ghetto ministry" for a couple months. She soon moved on to Philadelphia where she helped start the Welfare Rights Organization. After being fired from her job at the Health and Welfare Council, however, she was hired by the Diocese of Pennsylvania as a Suburban Missioner to organize suburban Episcopalians around social issues in the city. She left that position in 1972 to become a consultant for the Episcopal Consortium of Theological Education in the Northeast, where she taught classes in women's studies. After General Convention failed to approve women's ordination to the priesthood in 1970, Hiatt became active in working to achieve approval at the 1973 convention, and she was ordained a deacon on June 19, 1971, in the Diocese of Pennsylvania. That same year, she published Women Priests: Yes or No? along with Emily Hewitt. With opposition to women's ordination growing, Robert DeWitt proposed ordaining Hiatt as a priest at ETS in December 1973 without the church's blessing. While the ordination was called off and other events were taking place, Hiatt decided to organize separate actions with a few sympathetic bishops and other supporters. On July 10, 1974, Hiatt helped to organize a meeting in Philadelphia to plan an ordination service for women at the Church of the Advocate, where she was serving as a deacon. Because of her role in planning and orchestrating this service, Hiatt has become known as the "Bishop of the Philadelphia Eleven." After her ordination as a priest, Hiatt was hired along with Carter Heyward as a professor at Episcopal Divinity School, where she received tenure in 1981. Hiatt was the John Seely Stone Professor of Homiletics and Pastoral Theology at the seminary from 1993 until her retirement in 1999, also becoming the Acting Director of the Congregational Studies Program in 1997. Hiatt died of cancer at the age of 65 in 2002. 7\. Marie Moorefield Fleischer was born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1944. She received a B.A. from Wake Forest University in 1966 before attending Union Theological Seminary and Vanderbilt University, where she received her M.Div. in 1970. She was ordained as a deacon on June 9, 1973 in the Diocese of New York. Following her ordination to the priesthood, like many of the other women she found her priesthood rejected by many. For fear of being defrocked she left the Episcopal Church in 1975 and became a minister in the United Methodist Church. She served as the chaplain at the United Methodist Retirement Home in Topeka, Kansas from 1973-1975 and the chaplain supervisor at Richmond Memorial Hospital in Richmond, Virginia, from 1977-1979Episcopal Clerical Directory 2005, p. 290 Moorefield returned to the Episcopal Church in the 1980s, serving at churches in Maryland and West Virginia. She served as the Canon for Ministry in the Diocese of Western New York from 1992-1996, interim minister for a number of years, and Canon to the Ordinary in the Diocese of North Carolina from 2001-2006. In 1980 she married astronomer Robert Fleischer, who died in 2001."Obituary: Robert Fleischer, 1918-2001" 8\. Jeannette Ridlon Piccard was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1895.The Piccard Family Papers At eleven years old she told her mother that she wanted to be a priest when she grew up.Waggoner (1981) She received a B.A. in philosophy and psychology from Bryn Mawr College in 1918 followed by an M.A. in organic chemistry from the University of Chicago in 1919. That same year she married one of her professors, Jean Felix Piccard. The Piccards taught at the University of Lausanne from 1919 to 1926, when they returned to the United States. Jean had invented cluster high-altitude balloons, and together they invented the plastic balloon which would rise into the stratosphere. Because her husband suffered from acrophobia, he remained seated in the gondola from where he advised Jeannette as she piloted their plastic high altitude hot air balloon into the stratosphere in 1934. Together they ascended above Lake Erie to a height of l0.9 miles.
