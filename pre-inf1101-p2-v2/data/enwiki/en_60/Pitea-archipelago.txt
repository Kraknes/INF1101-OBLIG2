The Pitea archipelago ( or Pite skargard) is a group of Swedish islands in the north part of the Bay of Bothnia, at Pitea in the southeast of Norrbotten County. A few of the islands have small permanent populations, but most are used only for recreation in the summer months. They are icebound during the winter. ==Location== The north of the bay of Bothnia contains a large archipelago area. The islands in the Swedish sector make up the Norrbotten archipelago. It is divided into the archipelagos of Pitea (550 islands), Lulea (1,312 islands), Kalix (792 islands) and Haparanda (652 islands). Due to post- glacial rebound the land is rising at from annually, so the shoreline can retreat by as much as in one person's lifetime. As a result, the islands are growing in size and the waters and harbors are becoming shallower. ==Climate== The archipelago is only south of the Arctic Circle, so there is daylight for up to 24 hours in the summer, and moonshine may be visible all day in the winter. The waters around the archipelago are brackish, with less the 10% of the salt content of the Atlantic. The sea freezes in January and remain frozen until March-April. ==Islands== Baggen is one of the larger islands, with an open-air chapel and rental cabins. Fingermanholmen is almost in the center of Pitea, accessible by boat or kayak in summer, and by ski in winter. Mellerston has the only permanent residents of the archipelago. Pite-Ronnskar, with a chapel and a lighthouse, is located across the county boundary, in Vasterbotten. Other islands include Inre Morogrund, Mosesholmen, Hallskaret, Stenskar, Stor-Rabben, Svinora and Vargon. ==Nature reserves== There are several nature reserves, including islands and large areas of water. The Bondofjarden nature reserve is about to the southeast of Pitea town. Bondofjarden (with Stenskar and other islands), Stor-Rabben and Vargon are state nature reserves, but Pitea Municipality owns the land and manages the reserves. The former Patta Peken reserve, with Pite-Kluntarna and other islands, is since 2018 part of the larger Kallfjarden reserve (which also includes some islands of the Lulea archipelago). The Doman reserve is about south of Pitea town, covering the islands of Grasjalen and Doman to the south of Javre-Sandon. ==See also== *List of islands of the Pitea archipelago ==References== Citations Sources * * * * * * * Category:Swedish islands in the Baltic Category:Archipelagoes of Sweden Category:Landforms of Norrbotten County
