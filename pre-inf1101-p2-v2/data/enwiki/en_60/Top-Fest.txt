Top Fest is a music competition organised by Top Channel. It began airing in 2004 and has been held since. It is annually held in Tirana, Albania. The songs are usually performed in Albanian with artists from Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia and other Albanian-speaking territories. From its 7th edition (2010), the participants perform their entries 100% live. ==Format== Since 2010, the show has been split into three phases. The first phase airs all accepted entries, performing their entries in playback. The second phase is the Semi-Finals, usually split in three shows, where the winners from phase one perform. The qualifiers from the semi-finals perform in the final, usually 10 to 13 acts. The winner is chosen in the Finale-night, usually held in late- May or early-June. ===Winners=== The contest has produced many artists, like Alban Skenderaj, Elhaida Dani, and many others, who were established and rose fame after their participation in Top Fest. {| class="wikitable sortable" |- !
