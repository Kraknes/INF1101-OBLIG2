Phoenix Brussels is a professional basketball club based in Brussels, Belgium. The team has played in the top tier Pro Basketball League (PBL) since 2013. Founded as Excelsior Brussels in 1957, the club has won one Belgian Cup in 1995 and one Belgian SuperCup in the same year.

After 7 years in the 3e Nationale, the Belgian third division, Excelsior promoted to the 2e Nationale in 2009. In the first two years, Excelsior finished 4th and 5th and was defeated in the quarterfinals. In the 2011-12 season Excelsior reached the semifinals and in the 2012-13 season, it finished 10th while missing the Playoffs. The club moved to the professional Scooore League, the first tier in Belgium, for the 2013-14 season. Excelsior received a C-licence, which allowed them to play with a lower budget in the league. The club also got a new main sponsor in Basic-Fit, and was renamed Basic-Fit Brussels. During the 2016-17 season, Brussels participated in a European competition for the first time by entering the 2016-17 FIBA Europe Cup season. Brussels finished fourth and last in Group A, winning one out of six games. Along with this, the club finished in the third place in the Belgian League and reached the Finals for the first time in club history by beating Antwerp Giants in the semi-finals. On 2 July 2019, the club announced it changed its name to Phoenix Brussels. ==Honors and titles== Belgian Cup * Winners (1): 1994-95 Belgian Supercup * Winners (1): 1995 ==Season by season== {| class="wikitable" style="font-size:85%" |- bgcolor="" !Season !Tier !League ! ! !Belgian Cup !colspan=3 | European competitions |- |- | style="background:#efefef;" |2008-09 | align="center" | 3 | 3e Nationale | style="background:#BBF3BB" align="center" | 2nd | | style="background: " | | colspan=3 | |- | style="background:#efefef;" |2009-10 | align="center" | 2 | 2e Nationale | style="background: " align="center" | 5th | | style="background: " | | colspan=3 | |- | style="background:#efefef;" |2010-11 | align="center" | 2 | 2e Nationale | style="background: " align="center" | 5th | | style="background: " | | colspan=3 | |- | style="background:#efefef;" |2011-12 | align="center" | 2 | 2e Nationale | style="background: " align="center" | 4th | style="background: " | | | colspan=3 | |- | style="background:#efefef;" |2012-13 | align="center" | 2 | 2e Nationale | style="background: " align="center" | 10th | | | colspan=3 | |- | style="background:#efefef;" |2013-14 | align="center" | 1 | Division I | style="background: " align="center" | 8th | align=center|8-28 | style="background: " | Round of 16 | colspan=3 | |- | style="background:#efefef;" |2014-15 | align="center" | 1 | Division I | style="background: " align="center" | 10th | align=center|10-18 | style="background: " | Round of 16 | colspan=3 | |- | style="background:#efefef;" |2015-16 |align=center|1 |Division I |align=center|4th |align=center|21-16 |Round of 16 | colspan=3 | |- | style="background:#efefef;" |2016-17 |align=center|1 |Division I |bgcolor=silver align=center|2nd | align=center|28-19 |Semifinalist | 4 FIBA Europe Cup || align=center| || align=center|1-5 |- | rowspan=2 style="background:#efefef;" |2017-18 |rowspan=2 align=center|1 |rowspan=2|Division I |rowspan=2 align=center|8th |rowspan=2 align=center| 12-26 |rowspan=2|Quarterfinalist | 3 Champions League || align=center| || align=center|0-2 |- | 4 FIBA Europe Cup || align=center| || align=center|2-4 |- |style="background:#efefef;" |2018-19 |align=center|1 |PBL |align=center|3rd |align=center| 23-17 |Semifinalist |colspan=3| |- |style="background:#efefef;" |2019-20 |align=center|1 |PBL |align=center| 9th |align=center| 6-11 | | 4 FIBA Europe Cup || || 2-4 |- |} ==Players== ===Current roster=== ===Notable players=== ==Head coaches== * Serge Crevecoeur * Laurent Monier (February-March 2020) * Ian Hanavan (September 2020-present) ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Excelsior Brussels at Ethias League website Category:1957 establishments in Belgium Category:Basketball teams established in 1957 Category:Basketball teams in Belgium Category:Pro Basketball League Category:Sport in Brussels
