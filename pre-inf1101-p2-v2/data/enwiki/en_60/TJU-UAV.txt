TJU UAVs are Chinese unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) developed by Tianjin University (TJU). As an academic research and development establishment, TJU is only limited to the development of UAVs. The production and marketing of these UAVs are performed by two companies via joint development agreement with TJU, and these two companies are Noble Moral Aviation (Chen Yang Tong Fei Hang Kong Ke Ji You Xian Gong Si ) and Dong Xin Airlines (Chen Yang Dong Xin Ke Ji Kai Fa You Xian Gong Si ), both heardquartered in Shenyang. Some of the UAVs marketed by both companies are jointly developed by TJU and Shenyang Institute of Automation (SYIA, Chen Yang Zi Dong Hua Yan Jiu Suo ) of Chinese Academy of Sciences. As of 2013, all of UAVs developed by TJU and its associates are unmanned helicopters. ==Dolphin== Dolphin (Hai-Tun or Haitun, Hai Tun ) is an experimental UAV to explore the combination of coaxial unmanned helicopter with a pusher propeller mounted at the end of empennage, and this combined propulsion system provide a top speed in excess of 200 km/h. Dolphin is electrically powered, and maiden flight was completed on October 19, 2011. The general designer of Dolphin is Mr. Liu Bin (Liu Bin ).Dolphin UAV Specification:Dolphine unmanned helicopter *Length (m): 1.8 *Width (m): 0.3 *Height (m): 0.51 *Empty weight (kg): 6 *Payload (kg): 4 *Max take-off weight (kg): 11.5 *Remote control radius (km): 1 *Max speed (km/h): > 200 *Max wind scale allowed for operation: 5 *Power plant: lithium batteries ==40 kg class turboshaft powered UAV== 40 kg class turboshaft-powered UAV is an unmanned helicopter developed by TJU in conventional helicopter layout, and the landing gear consists of a pair of skids. The general designer of this UAV is associate professor Mr. Li Zhe (Li Zhe ), and it has been deployed in various missions in over twenty provinces in China.40 kg class UAV In one of the missions, the 40 kg class turboshaft powered UAV was deployed in archaeological missions during which the onboard sensor detected underground ruins of ancient Chinese capital of Yuan Dynasty.40 kg class unmanned helicopter ==120 kg class UAV== 120 kg class UAV is an unmanned helicopter developed by TJU in conventional helicopter layout, and it is powered by a piston engine. 120 kg class UAV adopts Fenestron tail rotor, and the landing gear consists of a pair of skids.120 kg class unmanned helicopter Specification:120 kg class UAV *Take-off weight: 120 kg *Payload: 40 kg *Power plant: 4 cylinder 4 stroke piston engine *Max speed: 120 km/h *Cruise speed: 95 km/h *Endurance: 1.5 - 3 h ==260 coaxial UAV== 260 coaxial UAV is an unmanned helicopter developed by TJU in a unique layout: it is a coaxial unmanned helicopter with tail rotor. This layout is claimed by the developer to have increased the speed by 60%, and it is powered by a 26 cc piston engine.
