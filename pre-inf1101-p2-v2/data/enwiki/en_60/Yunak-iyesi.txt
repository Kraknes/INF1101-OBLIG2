Yunak iyesi (Tatar: Muncha Iiase or Munca Iyase, Turkish: Yunak Iyesi, Azerbaijanese: Yunax Iyesi) is the bathhouse (or bathroom) spirit in Turkic mythology. Yunak means bathroom or bathhouse. In old Turkic culture, especially in rural areas, bathrooms are at a corner of the living room of the house. These are called the Caghlyk (Turkish: Caglik).Sozce - Turkish Dictionary Caglik But separate bathhouses (called Hammam)Design of the Turkish Bath, J. J. Cosgrove, were located in larger cities. Every Caghlyk or Hammam had an Iye (protector spirit), that called Caghlyk iyesi or Hammam iyesi. If disturbed by an intruder while washing, Yunak iyesi might pour boiling water over him, or even strangle him. Yunak iyesi had the ability to predict the future. One consulted him by standing with one's back exposed in the half-open door of the bath. He would gently stroke one's back if all boded well; but if trouble lay ahead, he would strike with his claws. ==Hammam iyesi== Hammam iyesi was the name of bath spirit in the Turkic mythology. They were akin to the bathhouse spirit Yunak iyesi. ==References== == External links == * Tatar Turklerinde Varliklar, Culpan Zaripova (Munca Iyase, Hamam Iyesi) Category:Iye
