The Posavac (Croatian; ), in Croatia also known as Posavina horse or the Croatian Posavac (), is a breed of medium-sized draught horse with a high capacity for weight pulling. Throughout its history, the breed has been popular for pulling wagons. It is also used for forestry, agricultural and other work. == History == The breed was developed in Posavina, a region alongside the Sava river in Croatia. It was based on a local Slavonian- Posavian horse breed called busak (bushak), whose mares were crossbred to quality stallions of other breeds including Arabian, Nonius, Noriker and Percheron. The majority of Posavina horses are in Croatia, but the breed is also present in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovenia, where it is reared principally for meat. The registered population of Posavina horses in Croatia was estimated at 5131 individuals in 2013., so the breed is considered endangered (FAO classification No. II). The total population in Croatia was reported to DAD-IS as 4500-5500 in 2012. In Slovenia the number was reported as 1260 in 2011. == Characteristics == The Posavina horse ranges from in height and weighs . It is smaller than two other Croatian cold-blooded horse breeds, the Medimurje horse (155-165 cm) and Croatian Coldblood (150-160 cm). The Posavina horse may be bay or seal brown, less often black or chestnut; other colours are much more rare. The head of a Posavina is relatively small, the neck short and muscular, the shoulder deep and broad, the chest wide and deep, and the legs are short and strong, with broad hooves. The breed is known for its easy-going temperament; it is mild and patient, obedient and willing to work hard.
