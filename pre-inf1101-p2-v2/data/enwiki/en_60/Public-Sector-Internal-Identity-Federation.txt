Public Sector Internal Identity Federation, or PSIIF, is an IT service developed by the British government. ==Service== PSIIF is an identity federation service, to allow civil servants and other public-sector actors to authenticate against other public sector IT systems; potentially offering Single Sign On across multiple departments and agencies, and on the G-cloud. This allows better sharing of information and services. PSIIF offers several "levels of assurance" of identity: {| class="wikitable" |- ! Level of assurance !! Identity verification !! Credentials !! Accreditation |- | 0 || None || Not applicable || Not applicable |- | 1 || BPSS and photographic ID || User ID and password || Self-assessment |- | 2 || BPSS and photographic ID || User ID and password; additional controls around the client device || Self- assessment |- | 3 || BPSS and photographic ID || Strong authentication, such as two-factor || Independent accreditation |- | 4 || National ID scheme || Not appropriate for PSIIF || |} Access to systems with higher-impact data would usually require higher levels of assurance. PSIIF is designed to support services handling OFFICIAL information, with business impact levels from IL1 to IL3. PSIIF will use SAML2. ==Project== ==External links== * High level technical architecture design for PSIIF ==References== Category:Cabinet Office (United Kingdom) Category:Public sector in the United Kingdom Category:Information technology in the United Kingdom
