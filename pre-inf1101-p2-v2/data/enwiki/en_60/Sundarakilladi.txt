Faced with a water shortage, the village-head (Nedumudi Venu), sends the character of Ashokan to inform Premachandran (Dileep) of the situation and to commission him to dig a well at Swapnabhoomi. Although Premachandran is the son of a renowned well digger, he is untrained in the profession and makes a living as a stage artist. Thus he's unsure of following his father's footsteps and tries to send away the group form Swapnabhoomi by quoting an outrageous fee for digging the well. The villagers readily agree to his terms and contracts him to the task by paying his charges upfront. Then he discovers that other workers who had tried to dig a well there died because of earthquake after digging 45 metres. He tries to escape from the people of Swapnabhoomi, but fails and starts the work as a challenge. Later, he falls in love with the stepdaughter of the physician Devayaani (Shalini Kumar), who treats him when he meets with an accident while digging the well. But the rule of Swapnabhoomi is that a girl of the village may only court a man who is from Swapnabhoomi itself. One day a man discovers their love and informs the head. The head orders them to stop seeing each other. If Premachandran disobeys, they will kill him and if Devayaani disobeys, then they will send her to a mountain where man eaters live. The head tells Premachandran that, if the well fills with water, then he can marry Devayaani. Later, Premachandran comes to know that on the last day of work, rain should not occur. Because of the fear, the head orders the destruction of the well, but Premachandran jumps into the well. When Devayaani learns about this, she breaks the rule and comes to see him. The people take her to the place where they have to do rituals and send her to the mountain. But water fills the well of Swapnabhoomi. Premachandran informs this to everyone and takes her to his home. ==Cast== *Dileep as Premachandra Sundarakilladi *Shalini Kumar as Devayani *Nedumudi Venu as Rajamanikkam *Babu Namboothiri as Somaji Vaidhyar *Kuthiravattom Pappu as Vasu *Nandhu as Pradeep *Asokan as Bhuvanappan *Remya Salim as Sumangala *T.
