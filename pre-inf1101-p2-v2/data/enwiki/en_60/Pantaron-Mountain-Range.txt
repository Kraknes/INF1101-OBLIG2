Pantaron Mountain Range, also called the Central Cordillera of Mindanao, Philippines is a mountain range straddling across the provinces of Misamis Oriental, Bukidnon, Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur, Davao del Norte and Davao del Sur. The range contains one of the last remaining old growth or primary forest blocks in Mindanao. Major rivers in the island also has their headwaters in the mountain range including Mindanao River, Pulangi River, Davao River, Tagoloan River and major tributaries of Agusan River. The mountain range has been noted for its cultural and biological diversity. Ethnic tribal communities such as the Manobos, Higaonons and Bukidnons are the inhabitants of the area. Ancestral domain claims within the boundaries of the mountain range have also been identified by the government for these ethnic minorities. Pantaron Mountain Range is one of the Philippines' few remaining biodiversity corridors with old growth forests. It is home to rare species of flora and fauna, including the critically endangered Philippine eagle and of other endemic and vulnerable fauna such as the Philippine brown deer, the Philippine flying lemur, and a Mindanao-endemic gymnure. The forests are threatened by mining and logging.
