William Devereux (1219 to 1265), was an important Marcher Lord, and held Lyonshall Castle controlling a strategically vital approach to the border of Wales. The castle's significance was heightened by the rebellion of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales. With strong family ties to the politically powerful families of Cantilupe and Giffard, his support was strongly sought after by Henry III and Simon de Montfort throughout the Second Barons' War. == Birth and Ancestry == William Devereux was born in 1219,Morgan G.

His father had risen to be a powerful member of the inner circle of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, which led to a prominent role during the regency of Henry III. The Devereux family had been prominent along the Welsh Marches since the conquest, and William was a descendant of the Domesday land holder, William Devereux.

His interests on the Welsh Marches were further guarded by his paternal uncles: John Devereux of Bodenham and Decies and Nicholas Devereux of Chanston. The close relationship of the Cantelupe family with Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester would later influence Devereux's decisions during the Second Barons' War. William Devereux's lands were taken into the King's hands on 17 March 1228Stephen Devereux's principal seat was at Lyonshall Castle in Hereford. His manors included Ballingham, Frome Halmond (Herbert), Stoke Lacy, Holme Lacy, La Fenne (Bodenham), and Whitchurch maund in Herefordshire; (Cheddrehole) in Somerset; Lower Hayton in Salop; and Wilby in Norfolk. Additional lands included Clehonger, and Staunton-on-Wye in Herefordshire; Crowle in the Royal Forest of Feckham, and Staunton in Worcester; Guiting and Oxenhall in Gloucestershire; and Trumpington in Cambridgeshire.

Page 259Isabel de Cantelupe's dower included Oxenhall, Trumpington, Frome Halmond and Whitchurch maund and initially placed under the control of Gilbert de Lacy, Lord of Weobley. De Lacy was summoned to mediate a dispute in 1229 over rent due the Prior of Leonard in Pyon (Wormsley) from the lands granted them by William's father, Stephen. When Gilbert de Lacy died about 1230, Devereux's estates were placed under the direct guardianship of Gilbert's father, Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath.On 2 May 1234 (Reading, Close, 18 Hen III, membrane 25) indicates that as Walter de Lacy was on the King's service in Ireland, the Sheriff of Hereford was commanded to respite till the Quizaine of Michaelmas the plaint in his county by the King's writ between Walter de Baskerville, complainant, and the said Walter deforcient, touching the daughters of Stephen Devereux. Gilbert de Lacy also was involved in an ongoing dispute that began in 1221 with the Abbot of Saint Peter's in Gloucester over the appointment of a priest for the Church of Stoke Lacy. Following his father's death, William Devereux became embroiled in this controversy, and ultimately yielded the right to the Abbots in 1261 (45 Henry III).William Henry Hart.

Part of the negotiation specifically provided for the release of the Marcher Lords who had supported Prince Edward. On 7 July 1264 letters of safe conduct were granted through 25 July to William Devereux and other knights of the Welsh Marches to come to the king.H.C. Maxwell Lyte (editor).

(London: Mackie and Co., 1910). 1264, July 7, St. Paul's, London, membrane 9 It is probably at this time that Devereux switched his allegiance from the king to Simon de Montfort. The decision was probably influenced by his cousin, Thomas de Cantilupe, who had been appointed Lord Chancellor on 25 February 1264. By December 1264 Montfort had dealt with the Marcher Lords, and on 20 January 1265 Parliament was assembled at Westminster including the knights of the shire, and representatives of the cities and boroughs. On 8 February 1265 William Devereux and John de Baalun were commissioned to inquire as to what appurtenances belonged to the office of gatekeeper for Hereford castle, which had been granted to Philip de Leominster.Calendar of Inquisitions Miscellaneous (Chancery) Preserved in the Public Record Office, Volume I.

When hostilities resumed with the escape of Prince Edward from captivity on 28 May 1265, the Welsh Marches erupted in rebellion and William Devereux now marched with Simon de Montfort. The two sides met at the Battle of Evesham on 4 August 1265, and William Devereux died while fighting for the baronial cause. == Marriage == He first married a daughterThe Welsh Assize Roll, 1277-1284.

He married a woman named Katherine who held Bishopstone in dower as a widow in 1316. They had children: Nicholas, Thomas, and John. Thomas Devereux inherited his estates, and was identified as being of Bishopstone in 1334. On his death Bishopstone passed to his son, Roger II of Bishopstone, and then to his grandson, Roger III of Bishopstone. Roger III Devereux is not recorded to have had an heir, and the lands appear to have passed back into the main Devereux line upon his death. William Devereux's first wife died about 1254, and he married a second time about 1258 to Maud de Giffard as her second husband.Her first husband, Baldwin de Freville had died about 1256, and wardship of his lands and the marriage of her and their sons, Baldwin and Alexander, was granted to Eleanor, Queen of England. Maud de Giffard had married Baldwin de Freville as his second wife around 1254. Baldwin's first wife Lucia (married about 1240), daughter of Richard de Scalers, had died in 1253 after giving him a son, Richard de Freville (born ~1241; died 1299). Baldwin de Freville and Maud had four children, Baldwin (born ~1254; died 1289), Margaret (~1255), Sibilla (~1256), and Alexander (born ~1257; died 1328) before he died about 1257. On the Patent Rolls for 10 July 1253 Baldwin de Freville sold to Sibyl Giffard the marriage of his son and heir (Richard). An inquiry in 1299 at Tadington described a messuage and 2 carucates land, and 64 s rent held of the King in chief by service of 1/3 knight's fee of the Barony of Cormailes; and 12 acres of land which he bought of fee of Monseleye. Lady Maud de Ebroicis, and Baldwin her son, and Alexander brother of the said Baldwin were jointly enfeoffed by a charter of the said land etc, excepting the 12 acres. The said Alexander is his next heir and of full age. She was the daughter of Hugh de Giffard and Sibyl de Cormeilles. Maud de Giffard's brothers were the politically powerful Godfrey de Giffard (Bishop of Worcester), and Walter de Giffard (Archbishop of York, and Bishop of Bath and Wells). Both brothers would later become Chancellors of England. Her sister was Mabel de Giffard, Abbess of Shaftesbury Abbey. William Devereux and Maud de Giffard had children: *Maud Devereux (~1259)Maud Devereux married Richard de Boylande who served as an itinerant justice in a dispute over land in Somerset in the year 1279, and for another dispute in 1288. In 1278, her mother and brother, William, gave reversion of Wilby in Norfolk to Maud and her husband, Richard de Boylande with a charter of free-warren for all his lands here and in Brisingham. By 1295 Richard de Boylande had a new wife, Ellen, suggesting Maud had died (probably before 1290), and William claimed an advowson on the property against Simon, Abbot of York, but lost the suit and was forced to abandon his claim. *Archdeacon John Devereux (~1261)JW Willis Bund (editor). Episcopal Registers, Diocese of Worcester: Register of Bishop Godfrey Giffard, Volume 1. (Oxford, James Parker and Co, 1902). Appendix IVJohn de Ebroicis entered the Church as was common for younger sons, and advanced under the patronage of his uncles: Godfrey de Giffard (Bishop of Worcester), and Walter de Giffard (Archbishop of York). He would hold the post of Canon of Ripon and Southwell by 1281 and Prebend of Oxton. His career would peak when he obtained the position of Archdeacon of Gloucester in 1288. In 1295 he also was inducted and resigned from the Benefice of Tredington in Worcester. In 1301 Bishop Godfrey de Giffard died, and identified his nephew, John de Ebroicis in his Will. He bequeathed him a mitre covered over with pearls, which had once belonged to his uncle the Northern primate (Walter de Giffard, Archbishop of York) in the hope, perhaps, that it might sometime rest upon his brow. *Master Thomas Devereux (~ 1263)Probably the Thomas de Ebroicis who was Rector of the Doncaster Deanery which was part of the Church of St. Elene's of Treatton belonging to the patronage of the Lords of Furnival. Treeton was part of the manor of Whiston. Thomas Devereux, clerk, also was collated to the Benefice of Tredington in Worcester following the resignation of his brother in 1295 * Sibyl Devereux (~1265)Sibilla is reported to have married Walter de Baskerville who died dsp. 1282. In the 1280s, Matilda, the widow of William de Ebroicis (and Sibilla's mother), contested William de Ebroicis (Sibilla's half brother) over 8 pounds of rent in Guleing (Gloucester) and Trumpeton (Cambridgeshire). William Devereux granted the right to the said rent to Matilda, and Baldwin de Frevil (son of Matilda). The remainder to Alexander de Freville (brother of Baldwin), and Margaret and Sibilla (and heirs of Sibilla) the daughters of Matilda. Sibilla married a second time to John de Acton. On Nov 11, 6 Edward II (1312), an IPM was done for John de Acton in regards to the manors of Couerne and Yausore, both in Herefordshire. The Couerne listing leads as follows: 10 d. yearly rent held of Richard Baskerville by service of  1/2 d. yearly; and a fourth part of the manor held, as the dower of Sybil his wife, of Richard de Baskerville by service of a  1/4 knights fee: she was dowered by Walter de Baskerville, her first husband. Yausore was held as above, by service of  1/4 knights fee. On November 20 of the same inquisition regarding Somerset, there is reference to the property of Ceddre Manor, a capital messuage of 40 acres arable land, 10 acres meadow, water-mill, rents, etc. held jointly by John de Acton with Sibyl, his wife, of a gift of William de Ebroycis of the Bishop of Bath. This was held by service of  1/2 knight's fee, and was to go to his heir. == Death == William Devereux was killed during the Battle of Evesham on 4 August 1265. His wife, Maud, applied to the King for a jeweled harness, which had been deposited in the treasury of the church at Hereford by her deceased husband. She obtained from the king a precept to the treasurer of the cathedral for their deliverance to her on 12 October 1265 at the request of her brother, Walter de Giffard, Bishop of Bath and Wells and the Chancellor of England.A E Stamp (editor). Calendar of Close Rolls, Henry III: Volume 13, 1264-1268. (London, 1937), pages 73-78. accessed 17 February 2016. William Devereux's lands were forfeited following this battle with exception by writ of the King on 3 October 1265 of Frome (Halmond), Ham (Holme Lacy), Wileby (Wilby), Oxonhal (Oxenhall), and 15 pounds of revenue in Heiton (Lower Hayton) for the maintenance of his widow, Maud. Sir John Giffard had been granted the lands of Gutinges (Guleing) and Oxenhale (Oxenhall) in Gloucester, and Maud de Giffard to hold of him.Calendar of Inquisitions Miscellaneous (Chancery) Preserved in the Public Record Office, Volume I. (London:Hereford Times Limited, 1916). Entry 675, Hundred of Bottelawe (Gloucester) On 12 October Maud's brother, Walter de Giffard, further granted her for life the manors of Frome (Halmond), Hamme (Holme Lacy), Oxenhall, Wilby, Trompiton (Trumpington), and La Fenne (Bodenham); and the rents of Ballingham, Guting (Guleing), and Heynton (Hayton); and the meadow of Jarchull to hold to the value of 60 pounds of land a year.H.C. Maxwell Lyte (editor). Calendar of the Patent Rolls, Henry III. (London: Mackie and Co., 1910). Volume 5, 12 October 1265, Westminster, membrane 5 Bishop Giffard's position as Chancellor of England would continue to facilitate the recovery of the Devereux estates. Roger de Mortimer was granted the forfeited lands of William Devereux on 20 November 1265 with the exception of Lyonshall castle, which would be held by his son, Ralph de Mortimer (died 10 August 1274). William Devereux's lands would later be redeemed by his son according to the Dictum of Kenilworth. These terms are described in an entry of the plea rolls from 1266 (51 Henry III, membrane 32): Whereas because of the trespasses which William de Evereus who stood with the King in the Battle of Lewes, was said to have done afterwards against the King and Edward his son, the King after his death gave his lands as he gave the lands of other adversaries in the time of the disturbance in the realm, and by the form of the award of Kenilworth, the King has power of making ordinances upon the state of such disinherited persons; he ordains that, as William the son and heir of the said William is prepared to stand to the said award to have his lands back, he shall pay within three years the ransom thereof to those to whom it belongs, to wit, the extent thereof for three years, so that according to the quantity of money he pays he shall have restitution of the said lands; saving to Maud late the wife of the said William for her life the assignment made to her of the said lands for the maintenance of herself and her children. William Devereux's widow, Maud de Giffard, died in late August 1297. On 3 September 1297 Maud (de Giffard) Devereux was buried in Worcester Cathedral in a place arranged by her brother, Bishop Godfrey de Giffard, near his burial site. == Notes == == Biographical References == * Brock, Holden.
