Up Late with Alec Baldwin is a late-night talk show that aired on MSNBC hosted by Alec Baldwin. The series lasted five episodes and aired Fridays at 10 p.m. from October 11 to November 8, 2013, in a time-slot previously held by Lockup. ==Description== Baldwin discussed current events and past experiences with various guests from news programs, politics, and the arts. The show used a multi-camera set-up. The set was fashioned after a New York City diner, and Baldwin conversed with his guests over coffee while sitting in a corner booth. The show began its run while the host was in the midst of a two-year contract with MSNBC's production arm, Universal Television. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Baldwin stated, "I'm going to do it for a year, and then we'll see what happens." On November 15, 2013, MSNBC announced that Up Late would be suspended for two weeks starting with that night's show after Baldwin received criticism for allegedly using an anti-gay slur while interacting with reporters. Baldwin denied the specific wording of the insult, though he still released an apology for the outburst. On November 26, 2013, MSNBC announced that they have fired Baldwin and cancelled his show as a result.http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/11/26/up-late-with-alec-baldwin- canceled-by-msnbc/218430/ ==Episodes== {| class="wikitable plainrowheaders" style="width:70%;" |- ! scope="col" style="background-color: #7CB9E8; color: #000000;" width=5% | # ! scope="col" style="background-color: #7CB9E8; color: #000000;" width=35% | Guest ! scope="col" style="background-color: #7CB9E8; color: #000000;" width=20% | Original air date ! scope="col" style="background-color: #7CB9E8; color: #000000;" width=10% | U.S. viewers (millions) |} ==References== ==External links== * *Baldwin's profile at MSNBC.com Category:2010s American late-night television series Category:2013 American television series debuts Category:2013 American television series endings Category:MSNBC original programming
