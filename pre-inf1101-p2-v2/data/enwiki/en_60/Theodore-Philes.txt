Theodore Philes () was a Byzantine nobleman and governor of Thessalonica in the mid-13th century. Theodore is the first notable member of the Philes family.Trapp (1991), p. 1650 He was appointed governor of Thessalonica by the Nicaean emperor John III Vatatzes sometime between 1248 and 1252, when the previous governor, Andronikos Palaiologos, died. This post, apparently designated with the title of "praetor", entailed a very wide remit, encompassing military, fiscal and judicial authority over the lands and cities of Macedonia that were in Nicaean hands.Macrides (2007), pp. 27-28, 242, 244 (note 7) During his governorship, Philes slighted the Nicaean heir-apparent, Theodore II Laskaris, who now became his avowed enemy. When Theodore II succeeded to the throne in 1254, Philes and another leading noble, Constantine Strategopoulos, were blinded at the emperor's orders for lese-majeste.Macrides (2007), pp. 321, 339ff. He was succeeded as praetor in Thessalonica by the historian George Akropolites.Macrides (2007), pp. 27-28, 321 Consequently Philes and his family became supporters of the aristocratic opposition around Michael Palaiologos, and after Theodore II's death in 1258 supported him in his bid for control of the empire against the regent, George Mouzalon.PLP 29812 In 1259, Michael Palaiologos, now emperor, sent Philes on a diplomatic mission to the Epirote court of Michael II Komnenos Doukas, but achieved no success, reportedly due to Michael's arrogance.Macrides (2007), pp. 354ff. Theodore Philes had one son, Alexios Philes, later megas domestikos. ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:13th-century Byzantine people Category:Byzantine governors of Thessalonica Theodore Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:Byzantine diplomats Category:People of the Empire of Nicaea Category:13th-century diplomats
