Escape departed Southampton on 29 October 2015 for her inaugural transatlantic crossing to her slated homeport of Miami, where the ship regularly cruised to the Caribbean. In the summer of 2019, the Escape repositioned to the New York Passenger Ship Terminal in Manhattan, and has been sailing seven-day voyages to Bermuda and will cruise along the New England coast, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick in the fall.
