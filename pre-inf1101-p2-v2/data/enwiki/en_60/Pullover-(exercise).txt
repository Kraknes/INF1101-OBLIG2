thumb The pullover is an exercise that is performed with either a dumbbell or a barbell.Neporent, Liz and Suzanne Schlosberg, Shirley J. Archer (2011) Weight Training For Dummies, pp.141-145. John Wiley & Sons. Google Books. Retrieved 14 October 2013. Pullovers can be made to affect either the chest or the back depending on how wide the grip is (barbell) and the position of the shoulders. A research done on the pullover movement using a barbell suggested more effect on the pectoralis major muscle as compared to the latissimus dorsi. ==Movement== A typical pullover involves resting the upper back on a flat bench. The hips are kept slightly flexed. Keeping the hips off the bench is said to help in balancing the weight and stability during the movement. The weight is held above the chest with elbows slightly bent. ===Variation=== This exercise can be done using either a straight barbell, EZ barbell, dumbbell or cable attachment. The elbows could also be bent at about 90deg to achieve a different stretch. In this variation the weight is lowered till the upper arm is in line with the torso. ==References== Category:Weight training exercises
