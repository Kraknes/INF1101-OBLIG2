Taxation in Missouri primarily takes the form of income taxes, sales taxes, and property taxes. The Missouri Department of Revenue administers and collects the income and sales taxes, including local sales taxes, whereas property taxes are entirely administered by local jurisdictions. In addition to the aforementioned taxes, excise taxes are imposed on cigarettes and tobacco products, motor vehicle leases, and locally administered income taxes within the cities of Kansas City and St. Louis. ==Income Tax== Missouri imposes an income tax, including an individual income tax, a corporate income tax, and a bank franchise tax. Kansas City and St. Louis impose their own "earnings taxes" on income. ===Individual Income Tax=== Most individuals who are residents of Missouri and have to file a federal income tax return are required to file a Missouri individual income tax return. Additionally, nonresidents of Missouri are required to file a Missouri individual income tax return if they have Missouri income of at least $600 in a year. Missouri statutes identify the rate of tax:Section 144.011, RSMo. {| class="wikitable" border="1" ! Income !!

Consequently, partners of partnerships, members and managers of limited liability companies, and shareholders of S-corporations report their share of the partnership, limited liability company, or S-corporation's income. ===Financial Institutions Tax=== This is a tax for the privilege of operating a bank,Section 148.030, RSMo. consumer credit or loan business,Section 148.140, RSMo. savings and loan association,148.620, RSMo. or credit union in Missouri.Section 148.620, RSMo. The tax rate is 7 percent of net income. ===Earnings Taxes=== St. Louis and Kansas City are permitted to impose an Earnings Tax on all individuals and businesses doing business within their city limits. All other municipalities are prohibited from imposing a tax on income. The earnings tax is one percent of income for residents, and one percent of income earned inside the city for nonresidents who work inside the city. ==Sales Tax== Missouri imposes a tax on all retail sales of tangible personal property and specified services. The state tax is four percent,Section 144.020.1, RSMo. plus one-eighth of one percent dedicated to the Department of ConservationMo. Const. art. IV, sec. 43(a) and one-tenth of one percent dedicated to the Department of Natural Resources.Mo. Const. art. IV, sec. 47(a). The state tax on food however, is one percent.Section 144.014, RSMo. (Food is still subject to the Department of Conservation and Department of Natural Resources sales taxes, as well as local sales taxes.) Missouri also imposes a use tax on tangible personal property that is stored, used, or consumed in Missouri but not subject to the sales tax.Section 144.610, RSMo. In addition to the state sales tax rate, counties, cities, and other political subdivisions are permitted to impose their own sales taxes.Sections 32.085, 32.087, RSMo. Counties and cities are also permitted to impose a use tax, although many do not.Section 144.757, RSMo. Consequently, in most parts of the state the sales tax rate is higher than the use tax rate. ===Motor Vehicles=== Until 2013, Missouri imposed a Highway Use Tax on all motor vehicles titled in Missouri but not bought in Missouri. As a result of litigation over the proper local tax to impose on such motor vehicles - sales tax or use tax - the General Assembly amended the sales tax statute so that sales tax is imposed on the privilege of titling new and used motor vehicles.2013 Senate Bill 23. Furthermore, motor vehicle leasing companies may elect to collect use tax on their lease receipts as opposed to pay sales tax when titling the vehicle in Missouri.Sections 144.440, 144.450, RSMo. ===Tobacco Taxes=== Missouri imposes a tax on the sale of cigarettes paid by the wholesaler and passed on to the final purchaser.Section 149.015, RSMo.

The tax rate is 2 1/2 mills per cigarette or 5 cents per pack of 20. Missouri also imposes a tax upon the first sale of tobacco products, other than cigarettes, within the state.Section 149.160, RSMo.
