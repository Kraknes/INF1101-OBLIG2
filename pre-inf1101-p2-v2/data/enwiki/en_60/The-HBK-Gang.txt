After contributing to various mixtapes and Iamsu's Kilt II in 2013, in August of that year the group released their debut mixtape Gang Forever. HBK Gang Records is the name of an associated independent record label. ==History== ===Founding=== The hip-hop collective HBK Gang, also known as the Heartbreak Gang, is primarily composed of friends who met while attending high-school in the San Francisco Bay Area, specifically Pinole. They founded the collective in 2008 while still in school, and members as of 2013 include Iamsu!, Kool John, P-Lo, Sage the Gemini, Skipper (or $kip), CJ, singer Rossi, Dave Steezy and Jay Ant (or Jay Anthony) , with rapper Iamsu! first starting to found and organize the group in 2011. Iamsu! was born Sudan Ahmeer Williams in Richmond, California, on November 17, 1989, and was an early fan of artists such as Kanye West, R. Kelly, Aaliyah, Marching Band, and reggae music. He later worked as a rapper and producer with artists such as Jonn Hart and Wiz Khalifa, and met P-Lo in 2005. P-Lo had been inspired by Kanye West's debut album The College Dropout to begin creating beats in his youth, and also produced for Wiz Khalifa "Bout Me" and Yo Gotti's single "Act Right" featuring Young Jeezy and YG, the latter of which peaked at #100 on the Billboard Hot 100. P-Lo joined Iamsu! in the production duo The Invasion shortly after their meeting, starting a trend of collaboration between future members. Iamsu! also collaborated with Sage the Gemini on Sage's track "Gas Pedal" in March 2013, which peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs and at #29 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it both artists' first top 40 hit. ===Early releases=== The Heartbreak Gang was performing and releasing music as early as 2011, and in August 2011 performed at the debut release party for Tha Outfit's "Like My Bass" music video. The group featured artists Dave Steezy and Mike Dash-E in their music, releasing the track "Gettin' It" featuring Kool John in 2012. In January 2013 Iamsu! was a guest for Jonn Hart on Hart's "Who Booty" video. The crew contributed to all of Iamsu's mixtapes, including Kilt II in June 2013, with other guest appearances including Problem, Juvenile, Ty Dolla Sign, Terrace Martin, Tank, and Mistah F.A.B. ===Gang Forever (2013)=== HBK Gang released their debut compilation mixtape Gang Forever on August 12, 2013. It includes 17 rap tracks featuring different members of the collective. Much of the album's production was handled by The Invasion (the production team of Iamsu!, P-Lo, Kuya Beats, Jay Ant, and Chief), with tracks also produced by Cardo, AKA Frank, Kuya Beats, Sage the Gemini, and Jay Ant. ===Touring, music videos=== The collective toured the western United States during September and August 2013, hitting locations such as Seattle, Spokane, Phoenix, Santa Barbara, and Reno. Titled the HBK Forever Tour, it featured Iamsu! as headliner and Kool John and Jay Ant as support. Hip hop dancing is an important element of the live shows. According to Sage the Gemini, dancing is also a key aspect of the group's creative process. The collective has released both tour videos and a number of music videos for their songs, including "Go Crazy". == Members== ;Current *Iamsu! - group founder, hip hop recording artist and producer from Richmond, California. *Skipper \- Rapper *Sage the Gemini - hyphy and hip hop recording artist from Fairfield, California, who released "Gas Pedal" in 2013. *P-Lo - rapper/member of the production team The Invasion *CJ - also goes by HBK CJ *Jay Anthony - rapper/member of the production team The Invasion *Kool John - rapper *Rossi - vocals *Azure - DJ/rapper *Dave Steezy - rapper *Kehlani - Singer ==Record label== HBK Gang is also the name of a record label, which as of 2013 has released most of Iamsu's mixtapes and albums, including Su!
