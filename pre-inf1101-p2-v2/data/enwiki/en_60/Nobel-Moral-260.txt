Nobel Moral 260 is a series of Chinese Unmanned Aerial Vehicles developed by Shenyang Noble Moral Aviation (Noble Moral, Chen Yang Tong Fei Hang Kong Ke Ji You Xian Gong Si ), which originally had jointly developed several unmanned helicopters with Tianjin University and Shenyang Institute of Automation (SYIA, Chen Yang Zi Dong Hua Yan Jiu Suo ) of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Based on the experience gained from these projects, Nobel Moral has since developed numerous unmanned helicopters of its own, and 260 series is a family of such unmanned helicopters based on TJU 260 gasonsline powered UAV. The general designer of these UAVs is Mr. Liu Bin (Liu Bin ), who is also the founder of the company.general designer ==260 first-generation gasoline- powered UAV== 260 first-generation gasoline-powered UAV is an unmanned helicopter developed by Nobel Moral.

Development was completed in October 2009 and the UAV has been in service since. Specification: *Length (m): 1.75 *Tail rotor diameter (m): 0.26 *Fuselage length (m): 1.48 *Width (m): 0.23 *Height (m): 0.58 *Weight (kg): 6.4 ==260 agricultural UAV== 260 agricultural UAV is an unmanned helicopter developed by Nobel Moral for agricultural applications such as crop dusting. Development was completed in March 2002 and the UAV has been in service since. Specification: *Length (m): 2 *Width (m): 1.2 *Height (m): 0.6 ==260 broadcasting UAV== 260 broadcasting UAV is an unmanned helicopter developed by Nobel Moral for broadcasting, publishing and media companies for aerial photography, utilizing nine servos and nine-channel control system. Development was completed in December 2009 and the UAV has been in service with various media firms (on contractual basis) since. Specification: *Length (m): 2 *Width (m): 0.74 *Height (m): 0.72 ==260 coaxial UAV== 260 coaxial UAV is an experimental unmanned helicopter developed by Nobel Moral in coaxial layout combined with tail rotors. In addition to combining coaxial rotors with tail rotors, another unique design of this unmanned helicopter is that the tail section is modular design that can be either a pair of tail rotors (with one mounted at the each side of the tail boom), or the tail rotors can be replaced with a pusher propeller. The developer claims that in comparison to traditional helicopter layout, 260 coaxial UAV design has increased payload by 20% and speed up to 60%. Another version has already been jointly developed with Tianjin University based on the identical pricinciple. Specification: *Length (m): 2.2 *Width (m): 0.74 *Height (m): 0.7 ==260 converted gasoline- powered UAV== 260 converted gasoline-powered UAV is an experimental UAV developed by Nobel Moral for testing first domestic gasoline engine specifically designed for unmanned helicopters. Although China has developed dozens of unmanned helicopters, all of them had to be either powered by imported aviation gasoline engines, because China lacked the capability to develop its own aviation gasoline engine specifically for unmanned helicopter use, but the price was too high to keep the final price tag of the completed unmanned helicopter developed by Nobel Moral at a low point to expand the market. As a result, Nobel Moral took on the task to develop a domestic Chinese aviation gasoline engine specifically for unmanned helicopter use by modifying existing methanol engine used on its unmanned helicopters. Development was completed in March 2006 and the UAV has entered limited service since. Although modifying methanol engine to enable it to consume gasoline fuel proved to be technically successfully, the UAV did not see wide service as other UAVs developed by Nobel Moral because it soon developed a cheaper alternative by incorporating 26 cc gasoline engine of lawn mowers for unmanned helicopter use. The technology developed for 260 converted gasoline- powered UAV, however, became available for customers who want to convert their methanol-powered unmanned helicopters to gasoline fueled. Specification: *Length (m): 1.55 *Width (m): 0.55 *Height (m): 0.5 ==260 maritime rescue UAV== 260 maritime rescue UAV is an unmanned helicopter developed by Nobel Moral for emergency respond applications.
