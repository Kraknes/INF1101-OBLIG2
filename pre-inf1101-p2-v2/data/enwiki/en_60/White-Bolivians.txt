White Bolivians or European Bolivians are Bolivian people whose ancestry lies within the continent of Europe, most notably Spain and Germany, and to a lesser extent, Italy and Croatia. Bolivian people of European ancestry mostly descend from people who arrived over the centuries from Spain, beginning five hundred years ago. Many are not white by American standards, but are mixed. European Bolivians are a minority ethnic group in Bolivia, accounting for 5% of the country's population. An additional 68% of the population is mestizo, having mixed European and indigenous ancestry. ==History== Compared to the Indigenous population, considerably fewer white and mestizo Bolivians live in poverty. Conceptions of racial boundaries in Bolivia may be fluid and perceptions of race may be tied to socioeconomic status, with the possibility of a person achieving "whitening" via economic advancement. Differences in language, educational status, and employment status may also reinforce perceptions of what constitutes a person as "white", "mestizo", or "Indigenous". ==Numbers== ===Census data=== In the official census in 1900, people who self-identified as "Blanco" (white) composed 12.72% or 231,088 of the total population. This was the last time data on race was collected. There were 529 Italians, 420 Spaniards, 295 Germans, 279 French, 177 Austrians, 141 English and 23 Belgians living in Bolivia. ===Surveys=== According to a 2014 survey by Ipsos, 3 percent of people questioned said they were white. ==Geographic distribution== Geographically, the white and mixed-race populations of Bolivia tend to be centered in the country's eastern lowlands. The white and mixed-race Bolivians in this region are relatively affluent compared to poorer, predominantly Indigenous regions of Bolivia. ===1900 census=== According to the 1900 official Bolivian census, a person who self- identified as "Blanca" white was a descendent of a foreigner, principally a Spaniard. Overall there are Italians, Spanish, Germans and French. In total, they represented 12.7 percent of the total population with large populations in Cochabamba and Santa Cruz representing 36.8 percent combined. {| class="wikitable sortable ! Departments !
