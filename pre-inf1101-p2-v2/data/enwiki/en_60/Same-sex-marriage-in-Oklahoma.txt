Same-sex marriage has been legal in the U.S. state of Oklahoma since October 6, 2014, following the resolution of a lawsuit challenging the state's ban on same-sex marriage. On that day, following the U.S. Supreme Court's refusal to review the case that found the ban unconstitutional, the federal Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the state to recognize same-sex marriage. On January 14, 2014, Judge Terence C. Kern, of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, declared Question 711, which banned the recognition and performance of same-sex marriage, unconstitutional. The case, Bishop v. United States (formerly Bishop v. Oklahoma), was stayed pending appeal.Federal lawsuit renewed against Oklahoma's constitutional ban of same- sex marriage Accessed December 11, 2010 On July 18, 2014, a panel of the Tenth Circuit upheld Kern's ruling overturning Oklahoma's same-sex marriage ban. However, the panel put its ruling on hold pending disposition of a petition for certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court. On October 6, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the request for review, leaving the Tenth Circuit Court's ruling in place. The Oklahoma Government responded by implementing the circuit court's ruling, recognizing same-sex marriage in the state. However, several Native American tribes in Oklahoma do not recognize or perform same-sex marriage, as the rulings do not cover the tribes under the laws of Tribal Sovereignty. ==Marriage== ===Non-binding resolutions=== In May 2012, the Oklahoma Senate passed SCR 62, a non-binding resolution reaffirming marriage between one man and one woman. It passed 40-4, with 4 senators absent from the vote. In April 2013, the Oklahoma House of Representatives passed HCR 1009, a non-binding resolution reaffirming marriage between one man and one woman, and urging the Supreme Court to uphold the Defense of Marriage Act and the right of states to regulate marriage. It passed 84-0, with 71 Republicans and 13 Democrats voting yes, while 16 Democrats walked out of the chamber instead of voting in protest. Republican John Trebilcock was also absent from the vote. The Oklahoma Senate later that month approved the non-binding resolution.HCR 1009 ===Statute=== In 1975, the Oklahoma State Legislature passed its first statute defining marriage as between one man and one woman.SAME-SEX MARRIAGE LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES (Current as of December 31, 2013) In 1996, the Oklahoma State Legislature passed its own Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as between one man and one woman and prohibited same-sex marriages from other states from being recognized in Oklahoma.Section 3.1 - Marriage Between Persons of Same Gender Not Recognized ===Constitution=== In April 2004, the Oklahoma Senate, by a vote of 38 to 7, and the Oklahoma House, by a vote of 92 to 4, approved of a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. On November 2, 2004, Oklahoma voters approved Oklahoma Question 711, a constitutional amendment which bans same-sex marriage and any "legal incidents thereof be conferred upon unmarried couples or groups",CNN: Ballot Measures, accessed May 15, 2011US judge strikes down Oklahoma gay marriage ban as 'arbitrary, irrational' (+video) such as civil unions. ===Tribal nations=== Oklahoma tribes for their citizens and on their reservation territory. Tribal members and non-tribal members residents may still marry under state law, while the tribe will not recognize it. Several same-sex couples have been issued licenses through the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, a sovereign nation within the borders of Oklahoma, since 2013. The Cherokee Nation and the Osage Nation also perform and recognize same-sex marriages. The former overturned its ban in 2016, while the latter approved the move after a 2017 referendum found majority support for same-sex marriage. Of the other Native American tribes, same-sex marriage is explicitly banned in the Chickasaw Nation, the Choctaw Nation, the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, the Seminole Nation, and likely is in Iowa. The situation in some of the smaller nations in unreported. ===Bishop v. United States=== On November 3, 2004, the day after Oklahoma voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, two lesbian couples, Mary Bishop and Sharon Baldwin, and Susan Barton and Gay Phillips, filed a challenge in federal court in Tulsa. The first couple was denied a marriage license by the Court Clerk for Tulsa County, Sally Howe Smith. The latter couple was married in Canada in 2005 and again in California in 2008. They were represented by Holladay and Chilton, an Oklahoma City law firm. County Clerk Smith was represented by the county's District Attorney and the Alliance Defending Freedom, a non-profit Christian advocacy organization. The case was originally Bishop v. United States and later Bishop v. Oklahoma when the part of the suit that named the Federal Government as a defendant was dismissed. ====District Court decision==== On January 14, 2014, U.S. District Court Judge Terence C. Kern ruled that Oklahoma's ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. He stayed enforcement of his judgement pending appeal. Kern wrote that the U.S. Supreme Court's dismissal of a similar case, Baker v. Nelson, in 1972 was not binding precedent because "there have been significant doctrinal developments in Supreme Court jurisprudence since 1972 indicating that these issues would now present a substantial question". He found that two of the plaintiffs, Barton and Phillips, lacked standing to challenge Section 2 of the federal Defense of Marriage Act because the federal officials they named as defendants had no responsibility for its enforcement and the record did not show that Oklahoma officials had failed to recognize Barton and Phillips' marriage in other jurisdictions. He noted that the couple "have played an important role in the overall legal process leading to invalidation of Section 3 of DOMA" and praised them and their attorneys "for their foresight, courage, and perseverance.Bishop v. United States, January 14, 2014 The Court agreed with the Bishop and Baldwin that Part A of the Oklahoma constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Court applied rational basis review and found the state's justifications inadequate, including encouraging responsible procreation, optimal child-rearing, and the impact on the institution of marriage. It said that part of the constitutional amendment was "an arbitrary, irrational exclusion of just one class of Oklahoma citizens from a governmental benefit." Of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on the issue of sexual orientation discrimination and equal protection, the decision said: ====Response==== Governor Mary Fallin said: "I support the right of Oklahoma's voters to govern themselves on this and other policy matters. I am disappointed in the judge's ruling and troubled that the will of the people has once again been ignored by the federal government." Attorney General Scott Pruitt called the decision "troubling" and said that the Supreme Court would have to decide the constitutionality of state bans on same-sex marriage. ====Appeal==== The defendant, County Clerk Smith, filed a notice of appeal with the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals on January 16 and asked the Court to expedite the appeals process and hear the case along with a similar Utah case, Kitchen v. Herbert. The same 3-judge panel of the Tenth Circuit that heard oral arguments in Kitchen on April 10 heard oral arguments in Bishop on April 17. On July 18, the court upheld the District Court's ruling in a 2-1 decision, concluding that Oklahoma's same-sex marriage ban violates clauses of the United States Constitution, though it immediately stayed its ruling pending disposition of petition for review by the United States Supreme Court. Stanford Law Professor Jeffrey L. Fisher, an experienced Supreme Court litigator, joined as lead counsel for those challenging Oklahoma's denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples in August. The Supreme Court rejected Oklahoma's appeal on October 6, 2014 and the Tenth Circuit Court's ruling subsequently went into effect, thus legalizing same-sex marriage in Oklahoma. Governor Mary Fallin sharply criticized the Supreme Court's action, but announced that the state would comply and begin licensing and recognizing same-sex marriages. Mary Bishop and Sharon Baldwin were among the first same- sex couples to apply for a marriage license, doing so at the Tulsa County Clerk office on October 6.First same-sex marriage license issued in Tulsa County ==Public opinion== {| class="wikitable" |+style="font-size:100%" | Public opinion for same-sex marriage in Oklahoma |- valign= bottom ! style="width:190px;"| Poll source ! style="width:200px;"| Date(s) administered ! class=small | Sample size !
