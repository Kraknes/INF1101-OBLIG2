Scott Jacobs is an American painter known for his photorealistic work of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Born in New Jersey, Jacobs currently lives with his family in South Dakota. His Birthday is October 24, 1958. == Career == Jacobs grew up in Cranford, New Jersey, and graduated from Westfield High School where he drew pen-and-ink illustrations for the school's newspaper. Jacobs worked for an art gallery as a teen and then went on to sell art out of his van. At 19, he purchased an art gallery at below market value and was an art dealer for 25 years. In 1989, his wife, Sharon, gave him an easel, canvases and paints as a Christmas gift. Jacobs began painting and displaying his work in his own galleries under the assumed name Escotete. Based on client feedback, he concentrated on creating work in a photorealistic style. In 1993, a short time after painting two pieces "Fat Boy" and "Live to Ride," which featured Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Jacobs' work was seen by the motorcycle manufacturer. Harley-Davidson signed Jacobs as its first officially licensed artist in its fine art program, a position he continues to hold. Jacobs' work has also been licensed by Chevrolet, Ford, Mattel, Marilyn Monroe Estates and Elvis Presley Enterprises and others. His work has appeared on Franklin Mint Collector Plates, apparel and other home decor items. As of 2013, Jacobs had been the official artist for the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally 17 times. == Museum exhibits and collections == Jacobs' work is in the permanent collections at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Beverly Hills, Cal., the Cobb-Murrieta Museum in Marietta, Ga., and the Milwaukee Museum. Museum exhibits include "Speed Demons, Race Inspired Motorcycle Art at the Journey Museum" in Rapid City, S.D., Aug. 2005, and "Wind Blown: American Motorcycle Fine Art" at the Marietta/Cobb Museum in Marietta. Ga., May-Aug. 2005. == Personal life == In 2012, Jacobs and his younger daughter Alexa were featured on ABC's reality show "Secret Millionaire," where wealthy participants live undercover for a week in poverty, and give to local nonprofit organizations. Jacobs gave more than $150,000 in donations to three groups: International Youth Organization, GI Go Fund and Glass Roots. In 2016, Jacobs suffered a serious injury after crashing during the Motorcycle Cannonball. Due to gravel on the road, Jacobs crashed his 1915 Harley-Davidson. His injuries resulted in broken bones, a bicep tear, and a shoulder replacement. It took seven months of recovery for Jacobs to begin painting again. == Books == Jacobs has published two books "The Motorcycle Art of Scott Jacobs" (2001), and "The Complete Work of Scott Jacobs" (2009). == Awards == In 1998, Jacobs received the Vargas Award for Lifetime Achievement in Fine Art. The award is named for painter Alberto Vargas. == References == == External links == * Jay Leno's Garage *Scott Jacobs Studio * Park West Gallery Interviews Scott Jacobs Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:20th-century American painters Category:21st-century American painters Category:21st- century male artists Category:American male painters
