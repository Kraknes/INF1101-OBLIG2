SLA UAVs are Chinese UAVs developed by Lanzhou Shenlong (meaning Divine Dragon) Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. (SLA Lan Zhou Shen Long Hang Kong Ke Ji You Xian Gong Si ), most of which are integrating commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) airframe with flight control systems indigenously developed by SLA itself. ==SLA unmanned helicopters== SLA unmanned helicopters are UAV developed by SLA by integrating COTS airframes with flight control systems indigenously developed by SLA itself. Every model of unmanned helicopter has applications in law enforcement, environmental surveillance, aerial survey, agriculture, disaster relief, engineering, mineral survey, and power line inspection. Most of the unmanned helicopters are gasoline-powered. {| class="wikitable" style="width: 100%; margin-right: 0;" |- ! style="background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;"| Model ! style="background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;"| SLA-260 ! style="background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;"| SLA-260ESLA-260 ! style="background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;"| SLA-260G ! style="background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;"| SLA-260H ! style="background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;"| SLA-520SLA-520 ! style="background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;"| SLA-520G ! style="background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;"| SLA-520H ! style="background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;"| SLA-520Hp ! style="background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;"| SLA-580 ! style="background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;"| SLA-Falcon (Lie-Ying or Lieying, Xi Ying ) ! style="background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;"| SLA-Falcon 111 ! style="background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;"| SLA-Falcon 112H ! style="background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;"| SLA-Falcon 170 |- | Main rotor diameter (m) | 1.7 | 1.8 | 1.8 | 1.85 | 1.9 | 1.9 | 2 | 1.9 | 1.9 | 2.2 | 2.2 | 2.1 | 2.6 |- | Length (m) | 1.75 | 1.75 | 1.75 | 1.57 | 1.95 | 1.95 | 1.85 | 1.8 | 1.95 | 2.15 | 2.65 | 2.15 | 3.35 |- | Width (m) | 0.38 | 0.35 | 0.35 | 0.45 | 0.38 | 0.38 | 0.65 | 0.35 | 0.38 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 |- | Height (m) | 0.55 | 0.6 | 0.6 | 0.74 | 0.69 | 0.69 | 0.78 | 0.68 | 0.69 | 0.65 | 0.75 | 0.785 | 0.75 |- | Weight (kg) | 7.5 | 7.5 | 7.5 | -- | 11.5 | 11.5 | 10 | 10 | 11.5 | 15.5 | 15.5 | 20 | 22 |- | Payload (kg) | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 ( 8 max) | 8 | 8 | 8 (10 max) | 8 (12 max) | 8 | 13 | 14 | 10 (15 max) | 20 |- | Power plant | 26 cc single cylinder | Battery | 26 cc single cylinder | G260PUH | 52 cc twin cylinder | 52 cc twin cylinder | Twin cylinder | Twin cylinder | 58 cc twin cylinder | 112 cc twin cylinder | 111 cc twin cylinder | Twin cylinder | 170 cc twin cylinder |- | Endurance (min) | 45 | 15 | 50 | 40 - 60 | 50 | 60 | 180 | 40 - 180 | 60 | 80 | 90 | 40 - 180 | 90 |- | Speed (km/h) | 90 | 90 | -- | -- | 90 | -- | -- | -- | 90 | -- | 90 | -- | 100 |- | Ceiling (km) | 3.2 | 2 | -- | -- | 2 | -- | 2 | -- | 3.2 | -- | 3.2 | -- | 3.2 |- | Operating temperature | -- | -- | -- | -20 to 50 degC | -- | -- | -- | -20 to 50 degC | -- | -- | -- | -20 to 50 degC | -- |- |} ==SLA multirotors== SLA has developed two multirotors as of 2013, and they are SLA-4600 quadcopter and SLA-4800 hexacopter, both are constructed of carbon fiber composite material and both are electrically powered. {| class="wikitable" style="width: 100%; margin-right: 0;" |- ! style="background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;"| Model ! style="background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;"| SLA-4600SLA-4600 ! style="background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;"| SLA-4800SLA-4800 ! style="background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;"| SLA-6100SLA-6100 |- | Length (m) | -- | 1.4 | 0.7 |- | Width (m) | -- | 1.4 | 0.7 |- | Height (m) | -- | 0.45 | 0.75 |- | Empty weight (kg) | 2.2 | 5.5 | -- |- | Payload (kg) | 1.5 | 5 | -- |- | Max take-off weight (kg) | 4.5 | -- | -- |- | Endurance (min) | 12 - 28 | 12 - 28 | 45 |- | Remote control radius (km) | -- | 5 | 30 |- | Speed (m/s) | 12 | 12 | 12 |- | Rate of climb (m/s) | 6 | 6 | 6 |- | Ceiling (km) | 4 | 4 | 4.5 |- | Max relative humidity allowed for operation | 80% | 80% | 80% |- | Operating temperature (degC) | -10 to 40 | -10 to 40 | -10 to 40 |- |} ==SLA-500== SLA-500 is a 70 kg class unmanned helicopter developed by SLA, and it is powered by liquid-cooled engine. SLA-500 has conventional helicopter layout with a pair of skids as landing gear. Maiden flight was completed in August, 2012.SLA-500 ==SLA custom-built unmanned helicopter== SLA custom-built unmanned helicopter is an unmanned helicopter developed by SLA that is based on ultra-light manned helicopter. SLA custom-built helicopter is converted from the airframe of a single-seat manned ultra-light helicopter that is also used on another Chinese unmanned helicopter, Blue Sky 100 kg class UAV, and as a result, externally, the two unmanned helicopters from Beijing Blue Sky Rise Science and Technology Co., Ltd. (Blue Sky, Bei Jing Lan Tian Fei Yang Ke Ji You Xian Gong Si ) and SLA are visually identical to each other. The difference is in their respective flight control systems which are independently developed by each company separately.SLA ==See also== List of unmanned aerial vehicles of the People's Republic of China ==References== Category:Unmanned helicopters of China
