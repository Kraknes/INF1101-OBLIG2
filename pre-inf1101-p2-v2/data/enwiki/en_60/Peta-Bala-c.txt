Even before it was taken the Santos players started walking to the centre line awaiting kick off because they knew he wouldn't miss. Santos lost 3-1. The Santos squad had the likes of Edu, Carlos Alberto and Clodoaldo who all won the 1970 FIFA World Cup with Brazil.https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/14/the-forgotten-story- of-pele-and-the-santos-touring-circus He got a call-up to the England youth team.

He joined Kaizer Chiefs in the famous 1981 quadruple winning season and won thirteen trophies in five years not losing a single cup final and set an unofficial world record of 21 consecutive clean sheets. The record was unofficial because South Africa had not been admitted to FIFA until 1992. He is infamously remembered for conceding a free-kick from the halfway line from Mlungisi Ngubane in 1984.http://www.iol.co.za/sport/professor-wants-to-teach- bucs-a-lesson-1.557026?ot=inmsa.ArticlePrintPageLayout.ot ===Later career=== Bala'c came back to play in the Devon South Western League under Johnny Hore in 1986 and played as a midfielder for Shell Swan and Chester Nomad Sixths in Division Two and the Chester Sunday League until retiring in his fifties.
