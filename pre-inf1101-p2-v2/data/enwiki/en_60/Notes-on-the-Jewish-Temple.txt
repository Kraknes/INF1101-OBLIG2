A Latin translation appears alongside the Hebrew and Aramaic phrases, together with additional explanations which are taken from the book "On Hebrew Abbreviations" by the Christian Hebraist, Johannes Buxtorf.

In addition, Newton uses a commentary about that prophecy description by the Spanish Jesuit, Juan Bautista Villalpando, and the critique about his commentary by Louis Cappel. This critique appeared on Brian Walton's multilingual edition of the Bible, of which Newton had a copy. The manuscript is dated between after 1675 and before 1685. ==References== * Unrivaled Unrevealed - Selected Treasures of the National Library, The National Library of Israel, Jerusalem (2011), pp. 30-31 ==External links== * Information on the book National Library of Israel website Category:Works by Isaac Newton Category:Hebrew manuscripts Category:Aramaic texts Category:Latin texts Category:17th-century Latin books
