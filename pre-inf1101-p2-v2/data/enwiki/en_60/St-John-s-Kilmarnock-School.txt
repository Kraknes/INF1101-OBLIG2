St. John's-Kilmarnock School (SJK) is a private, not-for-profit International Baccalaureate school located in Breslau, Waterloo Region, Ontario. Serving communities of Guelph, Kitchener, Waterloo and Cambridge, Ontario, it is accredited by the Canadian Accredited Independent Schools. SJK is supported by the charity, St. John's-Kilmarnock School Foundation. == History == In November 1971, one year before the opening of SJK, a group of people organized in St. John's Anglican church to discuss the opening of a local boys school. The next year, the opening date of the school was finalized as September 1972. The legislative assembly passed the St. John's School (Elora, Ontario, Canada) act in 1972 with royal assent. In May 1976, the St. Margaret's school for girls was opened in Elora. The two schools shared school buses, which brought in students from the Waterloo and Guelph region. They also shared St. John's Church for daily morning prayers, except on Fridays in which a longer service was held at the end of the school day. In 1989, the boy's and girl's programs joined after the amalgamation of St. John's and St. Margaret's schools in 1985. The school was moved to a temporary location on Phillip Street in Waterloo. In 1988, a 36-acre lot of land was purchased in Breslau and the construction began on the campus later that year. The new school door's opened for students in January 1990, and the campus was officially opened in 1995. Facilities have since been added to the Breslau campus to improve on academic and co-curricular activities. ==References== Category:Educational institutions established in 1972 Category:Elementary schools in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo Category:High schools in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo Category:International Baccalaureate schools in Ontario Category:Private schools in Ontario Category:Woolwich, Ontario
