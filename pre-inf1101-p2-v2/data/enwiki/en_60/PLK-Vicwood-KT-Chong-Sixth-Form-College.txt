It was Hong Kong's first and only government-subsidised sixth form school, on the former premises of Po Leung Kuk Wu Chung College, which had relocated to Sha Tin. In its first year, the school offered 16 disciplines. Use of English was the only compulsory module. The social sciences stream offered economics, principles of accounts, pure mathematics, business studies, and geography. Dr. Chan Siu Kui Darnay was the founding headmaster, previously having served as the head of Po Leung Kuk Tang Yuk Tien College in Tuen Mun. It opened on 12 March 1992. The official ceremony for graduation includes the speech days. The first speech day was held on 8 May 1993, officiated by Professor Gungwu Wang, CBE, then vice-chancellor of The University of Hong Kong. It developed into a tradition for the College's founding father, His Excellency Sultan Vicwood KT Chong (MBE, JP, Doctor of Laws), to hand out diplomas to honourable graduates.Twenty-second Annual Speech Day, 2014 === Academic Excellence === Photo of parents and students waiting outside applying for places. The College became a symbol of academic excellence, with positive results in Hong Kong A-level Examinations and high admission scores. Pass rates for all subjects have never been below the Hong Kong average, while credit rates for all subjects have been significantly above those of Hong Kong's since 1995. ==Education== The College started offering joint-degree programmes with overseas universities such as The University of Victoria, Canada and The University of Ballarat, Australia in 1996. Then headmaster, Dr Chan, noted when he signed the agreement with the vice-chancellor of Ballarat University, Professor David James, that the College had decided upon such direction due to the qualifications of its academic team. In 2000, the College was in preparation to add community college courses, offering associate degree courses with the first graduation held in May 2004. == Former headmasters == 1991-2007: Dr Darnay SK Chan 2008-2009: Mrs Iris WH Lau Lai 2009-2013: Miss ML Chik 2013-present: Dr PS Lee, BA, MA, MEd, PGCE, PhD == Notable alumni == * Kellyjackie - Canton pop star ==See also== *Education in Hong Kong ==References== Category:1991 establishments in Hong Kong Category:Educational institutions established in 1991 Category:Government schools in Hong Kong Category:Po Leung Kuk Category:Secondary schools in Hong Kong Category:Tai Kok Tsui
