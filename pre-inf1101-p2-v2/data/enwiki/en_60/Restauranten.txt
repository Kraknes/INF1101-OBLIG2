Restauranten in the 1890s Djursholms restaurant at the railway stop Restauranten. Postcard from ca 1900. Djursholms restaurant was a restaurant and meeting hall which, during 66 years from 1890 to 1956, was a social meeting point in the garden town Djursholm north of Stockholm. ==Origin== The restaurant was started by kallarmastare Wilhelm Strandberg, who was 25 years old at the time and had experience from Berns salonger in Stockholm, Sweden. The restaurant building was a villa at a property owned by Stockholm-Rimbo Jarnvagsaktiebolag in the block Gandvik, close to Samsoviken in Stora Vartan.Jan Otto Alrutz, Djursholms restaurang, artikel i Skrifter utgivna av samfundet Djursholms forntid och framtid, skrift XII, 1968 August Strindberg lived in Djursholm for a short period 1891-1892 and drew up plans for a theatre in the restaurant's large dining room. However, Strandberg still needed the room for the restaurant, so the plans were never realized. ==History== The restaurant got a new design in 1895 and another in 1902, both drawn by architect Gustaf Lindgren.Ernst Beckman: En bok om Djursholm och om dess villastad, om slottet och dess historia, om godsets egare m.m., Ny uppl., 1897, Stockholm, swe, 194199 Strandberg left in 1898 to open the restaurant Metropol at Norrmalmstorg. The locations were used for a traditional restaurant, for private and public parties and for municipal meetings. The restaurant was closed between 1919 and 1921. The railway company then sold to newly founded company Djursholms Restaurangaktiebolag, co-owned by Djursholms AB, the railway company and private investors.
