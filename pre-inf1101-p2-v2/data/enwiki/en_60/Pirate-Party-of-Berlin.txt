Their previous vote of 8.9% achieved in 2011 fell to 1.7% and the Pirate party lost all representation in the Berlin State assembly. The poor result was compounded by the murder suicide of former Pirate party assembly member Gerwald Claus- Brunner who wheeled the body of a young man whom he had murdered through the streets of Berlin in a handcart.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/22/gerwald-claus-brunner- german-pirate-party-politician-confessed-before-suicide == See also == * Pirate Party Germany * Pirate Party ==References== == External links == * Website of the Pirate Party Berlin * Website of the Pirate Party Berlin parliamentary group Category:Pirate Party Germany Category:Liberal parties in Germany
