Viva la Muerte (English: Long Live Death) is a 1971 French-Tunisian drama film shot in Tunisia and directed by Fernando Arrabal. The film was released on 12 May 1971 and Arrabal drew on his own childhood for inspiration for the movie. Viva la Muerte takes place at the end of the Spanish Civil War, telling the story of Fando, a young boy whose father was turned in to authorities as a suspected communist by his falange-sympathizing mother. It has gained cult popularity as a midnight movie. The opening credits sequence features drawings by acclaimed artist, actor and novelist Roland Topor. ==Synopsis== When Fando's fascist-sympathizing mother turns his father into the authorities as a suspected communist, Fando (Mahdi Chaouch) is told that his father was executed. In truth the father is actually just imprisoned and eventually begins to search for him, constantly imagining what his father might be up to or what might have happened to him. ==Cast== *Anouk Ferjac as La Tante *Nuria Espert as La Mere *Mahdi Chaouch as Fando *Ivan Henriques as Le Pere *Jazia Klibi as Therese *Suzanne Comte as La Grand-mere *Jean-Louis Chassigneux as Le Grand-pere *Mohamed Bellasoued as Colonel *Victor Garcia as Fando - 20 ans ==Reception== Allmovie gave Viva la Muerte four stars, remarking that the film's extreme visuals would make it "not for the faint of heart".
