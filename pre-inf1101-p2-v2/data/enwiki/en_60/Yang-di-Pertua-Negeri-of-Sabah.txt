The Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sabah is the ceremonial head of state of the Malaysian state of Sabah. Other meaning is "His Excellency" Governor of state of Sabah.

The current office bearer, Juhar Mahiruddin, was sworn in on 1 January 2011. == Appointment == The office of the Yang di-Pertua Negeri (Governor) is established by the Constitution of Sabah. According to Article 1 (1) of the Constitution, the office must exist and be appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) after consultation with the Chief Minister. Every governor is appointed for a term of 4-years. However, the King reserves the power to extend his term of appointment. The Governor has neither deputy nor assistant.
