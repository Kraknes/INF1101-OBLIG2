After Olivia's name is leaked to the press as Fitz's mistress, Olivia Pope & Associates face financial troubles when all their clients fire them. The firm accepts "new" clients in order to pay the bills. Rowan becomes more involved with Olivia's life, which begins to affect her, and leads Huck and Jake to investigate B613. They discover during a military action code named "Operation Remington" Fitz shot down a civilian aircraft over Iceland and Olivia's mother was one of over 300 casualties. Olivia goes to Fitz and asks him about it, but he refuses to respond. Determined to find out the truth about Operation Remington, the firm investigates Rowan and learns that a passenger was removed from the flight by a Federal Marshall just prior to take off. Quinn starts to hang out with Charlie, who sets her up to kill a security guard who was an eye-witness to the Federal Marshall's removal of the passenger. As a result of Quinn's inadvertent murder, Huck tortures her and she leaves the firm. It's revealed that Maya was the passenger who didn't get on the plane, and that she has been imprisoned by Rowan for the last 20 years. She manages to break free and Olivia is shocked when her "dead" mother contacts her. When Rowan finds out about Maya's escape, he puts her on FBI's most wanted terrorists list. Olivia manages to arrange a flight to Hong Kong with Maya on it, but after she leaves Olivia figures out that Maya really is a terrorist by the name Marie Wallace. After Fitz captures Rowan at the Pentagon, Olivia asks Fitz to arrest her mother, but Maya manages to escape. Meanwhile, Fitz faces problems when Congresswoman Josephine "Josie" Marcus is in the running to win the Democratic Party primary against Senator Samuel Reston and become the first female president of the United States. Cyrus tries his best to find dirt on Marcus in order to ruin her campaign, but fails. After Olivia finds out that Fitz shot down the plane which killed her mother, she declines the offer of being the campaign manager for Fitz's re-election and becomes the manager for Josephine Marcus'. After an incident with Marcus' sister, Josephine backs out of her campaign. Cyrus discovers that Sally plans to run against Fitz as an Independent when she hires Leo Bergen to be her campaign manager. He tries to blackmail her by having James flirt with her husband, Daniel Douglas. However, James figures out Cyrus' plan, and sleeps with Daniel devastating Cyrus. When Sally finds out about this, she becomes furious and kills her husband. After the murder, Sally calls Cyrus for help. David gets a visit from a woman from the NSA who has the recording of the conversation between Sally and Cyrus, which David shares with James. The second part of the season focuses more on the re-election campaign as Olivia has taken over as the campaign manager. At the same time, Sally announces that she is running for President by being an Independent. As a result, Fitz chooses the Governor of California, Andrew Nichols, as his new Vice Presidential running-mate. It is revealed that Nichols had a romantic relationship with the First Lady, Mellie. The campaign faces problems when Sally, stricken with guilt over murdering Daniel, almost reveals the truth at a debate. Cyrus asks Jake to help protect the secret, which he does by killing James to prevent exposing Cyrus's involvement in the cover up. The president's eldest children, Jerry and Karen Grant, come to the White House for an interview, but Olivia soon figures out that they aren't pleased with their parents. Maya and Adnan Salif team up with Dominic Bell, who gives them a bomb. Olivia and her team, with the help of Rowan, track down Dominic and try to find Maya. In the season finale, the bomb goes off in a church, which Sally uses to her advantage to rise in the polls. On the election day, Olivia and Cyrus are convinced that Fitz has lost, but Rowan orders Tom to kill Jerry, which ultimately makes Fitz win the election. Olivia takes up her father's offer and leaves with Jake to an unknown location for a new life. ==Cast and characters== ===Main=== * Kerry Washington as Olivia Pope * Columbus Short as Harrison Wright * Scott Foley as Jacob "Jake" Ballard * Darby Stanchfield as Abigail "Abby" Whelan * Katie Lowes as Quinn Perkins * Guillermo Diaz as Huck * Jeff Perry as White House Chief of Staff Cyrus Beene * Joshua Malina as David Rosen * Bellamy Young as First Lady Melody "Mellie" Grant * Tony Goldwyn as President Fitzgerald "Fitz" Thomas Grant III ===Recurring=== * Joe Morton as Rowan "Eli" Pope * Kate Burton as Vice President Sally Langston * George Newbern as Charlie * Paul Adelstein as Leo Bergen * Khandi Alexander as Maya Lewis/Marie Wallace * Dan Bucatinsky as James Novak * Brian Letscher as Tom Larsen * Sharmila Devar as Lauren Wellman * Jon Tenney as Governor Andrew Nichols * Nazanin Boniadi as Adnan Salif * Jack Coleman as Second Gentleman Daniel Douglas Langston * Lisa Kudrow as Congresswoman Josephine "Josie" Marcus * Tom Amandes as Governor Samuel Reston * Samantha Sloyan as Jeannine Locke * Dylan Minnette as Fitzgerald "Jerry" Grant IV * Sally Pressman as Candace Marcus * Carlo Rota as Ivan * Erica Shaffer as News Reporter * Madeline Carroll as Karen Grant * Mackenzie Astin as Noah Baker ===Guest stars=== * Cynthia Stevenson as Mary Nesbitt * Norm Lewis as Senator Edison Davis * Mark Moses as Congressman Jim Struthers * Ernie Hudson as FBI Commander Randolph Boles * Gregg Henry as Hollis Doyle * Patrick Fabian as Senator Richard Meyers * Melora Hardin as Shelley Meyers * Barry Bostwick as Fitzgerald Grant II * Brenda Strong as Joan Reston * Sebastian Roche as Dominic Bell ==Production== Scandal was renewed for a third season on May 10, 2013.
