The Ulster Institute for the Deaf (UID) was a Northern Ireland charity based in Belfast to support the Deaf Community in Ulster. In 1991 it merged into the Royal National Institute for the Deaf, now Action on Hearing Loss. It was originally an educational institution at Fisherwick Place, Belfast, where Francis Maginn (1861 - 1918), one of the founders of the British Deaf Association was its first superintendent. ==References== == External links == *The Ulster Institute For The Deaf, Dumb And Blind 1897, Belfast, photograph Category:Charities based in Northern Ireland Category:Medical and health organisations based in Northern Ireland Category:Deafness charities Category:Deaf culture in the United Kingdom
