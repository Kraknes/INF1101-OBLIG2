The center conducts research in four areas: personalization, advertising, mobile and cloud computing. It employs almost 400 full-time researchers and engineers. The center operates under a mission of Platform as a service (PaaS) through a combination of science and engineering. The center maintains a research agenda that concentrates on four areas: *Personalization-research on modeling content understanding, user behavior, and interests, as well as machine-learning ranking. The research sought to improve to select, match and sort contents and to understand what users like.A learning infrastructure was built to support the engineering life cycle: streamline the steps from user activity instrumentation to signal collection and processing, feature extraction, model training, offline evaluation, and online bucket testing. *Advertising-research on targeted advertising, real-time bidding and search advertising. *Mobile-research on mobile backend services, application and mobile SDK(basic building blocks). *Cloud computing-infrastructure to build big data platforms that enable next-generation mathematical models, real-time insights and predictive analytics, by improving service containers to scale only horizontally and vertically across abstraction layers. The next-generation data storage system supports multi-petabyte scale data, and offers storage services to Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Messenger and Flickr. ==University relations== ===Hack day=== On May 19, 2013, Yahoo Beijing R&D; Hack Day was held in Beijing, the first in mainland China.
