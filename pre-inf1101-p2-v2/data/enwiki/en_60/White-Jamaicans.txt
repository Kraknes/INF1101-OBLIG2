White Jamaicans are Jamaicans whose ancestry lies within the continent of Europe, most notably Great Britain, Ireland, Spain, Germany and Portugal. In 2018, the population was said to be 12,382 people, equating to 0.4% of the overall population. Historically White Jamaicans made up a much larger percentage of the population, forming a majority for most of the 17th century. ==Terminology== A number of Jamaicans have light skin, European features, and majority European ancestry. In colonial times it was common for such people to identify simply as "white", but since independence it has been more common for them to identify as "brown" or "mulatto". In modern Jamaica the category "white" is applied. For instance, four of the first six Jamaican heads of government (Norman Manley, Alexander Bustamante, Edward Seaga, and Michael Manley) had a European appearance and majority Caucasian ancestry, but were not generally considered "white" within Jamaica. Foreign writers applying their own countries' racial standards would sometimes identify them as white - writing for The New York Times, Nicholas Kristof observed that a "95 per cent black population elected a white man - Edward Seaga - as its prime minister". Seaga was born to a Lebanese father and a mixed-race mother. ==Demographic history== The proportion of white people among the overall population in Jamaica has varied considerably since the establishment of a permanent Spanish settlement in 1509 by Juan de Esquivel. The native Taino people were virtually extinct by 1600 and the island's population of about 3,000 was then overwhelmingly European. However, over the next century a significant numbers of African slaves were brought to the island. Jamaica became a colony of England in 1655 and a census in 1662 recorded 3,653 whites (87% of the population) and 552 blacks (13% of the population). However, by 1673 there were 7,768 whites (45% of the population) and 9,504 blacks (55% of the population). By the end of the century only about 7,000 out of a total population of 47,000 (or 15%) were white. Most white immigrants were British, many coming voluntarily from other North American colonies or as refugees from colonies like Montserrat and Suriname, which were captured by other European powers. By 1734, the proportion of white people had decreased to below 10% of the overall population of Jamaica.Historial Background, Jamaican Family Search. In 1774, Edward Long estimated that a third of Jamaica's white population were Scottish, mostly concentrated in Westmoreland Parish. In 1787, there were only 12,737 whites out of a total population of 209,617. There was a flow of French refugees to Jamaica after the Haitian Revolution, though not all remained in the country. In the 1830s, over 1,000 Germans immigrated to Jamaica to work on Lord Seaford's estate. The 1844 census showed a white population of 15,776 out of a total population of 377,433 (around 4%). According to the 1871 census, at least 25% of the population was coloured (having mixed black and white ancestry). The 1960 census recorded a white population of 0.77 percent, which decreased to 0.66 in 1970, 0.18 in 2001, and 0.16 in 2011.Race and Ethnicity Matter in Jamaica? Category Labels versus Personal Self- descriptions of Identity, ResearchGate, 2007 As with most Anglo-Caribbean countries, most Jamaicans who are of mixed ancestry self- report as 'black'. In 2011, the CIA World Factbook estimated that the population of Jamaicans who are of mixed European and African ancestry is at about 96%. ==Notable White Jamaicans== *Gerry Alexander (1928-2011), West Indies cricket captain *Peter Beckford (junior) (1672-1735), politician *William Beckford (1709-1770), plantation owner, Lord Mayor of London *Martine Beswick (b. 1941), actress, Bond girl *Cindy Breakspeare (b. 1954), model, Miss World 1976 *Lady Colin Campbell (b. 1949), socialite and writer *Frederic G.
