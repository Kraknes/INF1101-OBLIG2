The Women's Flat Track Derby Association Division 3 (WFTDA Division 3) was the third level of play in women's flat track roller derby, from 2013 through 2014. ==Organisation== Historically, the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA) operated four regions, based on geographic location: East, North Central, South Central and West. At the start of 2013, these were replaced by three divisions, each operating worldwide. However, foreseeing continued growth in membership, the WFTDA stated that future developments were likely to include new regional structures alongside the divisional system. Division 1 comprised the top 40-ranked member leagues, and Division 2 comprised those ranked 41-100; Division 3 consisted of member leagues who were ranked below 100. WFTDA rankings are set at the start of each year, based on performance over the previous year. Although rankings are updated during the year, teams would only transfer between divisions at the start of each year. Teams which graduated from the WFTDA Apprentice Program during the year were placed in Division 3. After the 2014 tournament season, the definition of the WFTDA competitive divisions changed, and Division 2 was contracted from 60 teams (places 41-100) to 20 (only those teams qualifying for the WFTDA Division 2 tournament, places 41-60). With this update, in-season division assignments no longer applied, and as such Division 3 is no longer active. Although there was no end-of-year Division 3 Playoff, teams in Division 3 could qualify for one of the end-of-year Division 1 or Division 2 playoff tournaments if they were ranked in WFTDA's top sixty at the end of June each year. ==Member leagues== The initial Division 3 membership list was introduced ahead of the 2013 competitive season, comprising the teams that had been ranked at 26 and lower in each of the four previous geographic regions, plus teams that had yet to earn a rank. Teams were automatically added to Division 3 upon gaining membership. The final publication of Division 3 designation was in the October 2014 rankings release, and the below lists teams that were members at any time from the beginning of the designation, through October 2014. {| class="wikitable sortable" !League !City !Country !Year(s) of membership !Status |- |Alamo City Rollergirls||San Antonio, TX||United States||2014||out of Playoffs |- |Ann Arbor Derby Dimes||Ann Arbor, MI||United States||2013,"WFTDA Welcomes 22 New Full Member Leagues", WFTDA, 23 December 2013 2014||Division 1 |- |Appalachian Rollergirls||Banner Elk, NC||United States||2014||out of Playoffs |- |Ark Valley High Rollers||Salida, CO||United States||2013, 2014||out of Playoffs |- |A'Salt Creek Roller Girls||Casper, WY||United States||2014||out of Playoffs |- |Assassination City Roller Derby||Plano, TX||United States||2014||out of Playoffs |- |Assault City Roller Derby||Syracuse, NY||United States||2013,"WFTDA Welcomes First Full Member Leagues in Asia and South America", 6 June 2013 2014||out of Playoffs |- |Auld Reekie Roller Girls||Edinburgh||Scotland||2013||Division 2 |- |Babe City Rollers||Bemidji, MN||United States||2014||out of Playoffs |- |Bakersfield Diamond Divas||Bakersfield, CA||United States||2014||out of Playoffs |- |Bay State Brawlers||Brighton, MA||United States||2014||out of Playoffs |- |Bear City Roller Derby||Berlin||Germany||2013, 2014||Division 2 |- |Bellingham Roller Betties||Bellingham, WA||United States||2014||out of Playoffs |- |Black-n-Bluegrass RollerGirls||Covington, KY||United States||2013, 2014||out of Playoffs |- |Black Rose Rollers||Hanover, PA||United States||2013, 2014||out of Playoffs |- |Boulder County Bombers||Longmont, CO||United States||2013,"WFTDA Welcomes 14 Full Member Leagues", WFTDA, 10 September 2013 2014||out of Playoffs |- ||Border City Brawlers||Windsor, ON||Canada||2013, 2014||out of Playoffs |- |Brandywine Roller Girls||Downingtown, PA||United States||2013||out of Playoffs |- |Canberra Roller Derby League||Canberra, ACT||Australia||2014||out of Playoffs |- |Cajun Rollergirls||Houma, LA||United States||2013,"WFTDA Welcomes 5 New Members", WFTDA, 7 March 2013 2014||out of Playoffs |- |Calgary Roller Derby Association||Calgary, AB||Canada||2013, 2014||Division 1 |- |Cape Fear Roller Girls||Wilmington, NC||United States||2014||out of Playoffs |- |Castle Rock 'n' Rollers||Castle Rock, CO||United States||2013||out of Playoffs |- |Cedar Rapids RollerGirls||Cedar Rapids, IA||United States||2013, 2014||out of Playoffs |- |Cedar Valley Derby Divas||Waterloo, IA||United States||2013, 2014||out of Playoffs |- |Cen-Tex Rollergirls||Temple, TX||United States||2013, 2014||out of Playoffs |- |Central City Rollergirls||Birmingham||England||2013, 2014||out of Playoffs |- |Central Coast Roller Derby||Paso Robles, CA||United States||2013, 2014||out of Playoffs |- |Central New York Roller Derby||Utica, NY||United States||2014||out of Playoffs |- |Charlotte Roller Girls||Charlotte, NC||United States||2013||out of Playoffs |- |Charlottesville Derby Dames||Charlottesville, VA||United States||2013, 2014||Division 1 |- |Chattanooga Roller Girls||Chattanooga, TN||United States||2013, 2014||out of Playoffs |- |Chemical Valley Rollergirls||Charleston, WV||United States||2014||out of Playoffs |- |Cherry City Derby Girls||Salem, OR||United States||2013, 2014||out of Playoffs |- |Cheyenne Capidolls||Cheyenne, WY||United States||2013, 2014||out of Playoffs |- |Chippewa Valley Roller Girls||Eau Claire, WI||United States||2014||out of Playoffs |- |Choice City Rebels||Fort Collins, CO||United States||2013||disbandedChoice City appears to have gone dormant after 2012, and while placed in D3 for 2013 did not bout that year |- |Circle City Derby Girls||Indianapolis, IN||United States||2013, 2014||out of Playoffs |- |Classic City Rollergirls||Athens, GA||United States||2013, 2014||out of Playoffs |- |CoMo Derby Dames||Columbia, MO||United States||2013, 2014||out of Playoffs |- |Confluence Crush Roller Derby||St. Louis, MO||United States||2013, 2014||out of Playoffs |- |Copenhagen Roller Derby||Copenhagen||Denmark||2013, 2014||out of Playoffs |- |Cornfed Derby Dames||Muncie, IN||United States||2013, 2014||out of Playoffs |- |Cowboy Capital Rollergirls||Stephenville, TX||United States||2013, 2014||disbandedCowboy Capital last played and was last ranked by the WFTDA in March 2015 |- |Crime City Rollers||Malmo||Sweden||2013, 2014||Division 1 |- |Crossroads City Derby||Las Cruces, NM||United States||2014||out of Playoffs |- |Denali Destroyer Dolls||Wasilla, AK||United States||2013||left WFTDADenali left the WFTDA at some point, having never gained a ranking.
