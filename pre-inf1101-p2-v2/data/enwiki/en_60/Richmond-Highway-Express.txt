REX operates seven days a week with frequent service during peak hours. Off peak hours service runs every 30 minutes, and Sunday service runs every 60 minutes. During holidays, a Saturday Supplemental schedule is added to bring more service to the REX. All runs take place on board the 2009 New Flyer DE40LFA diesel-electric hybrid buses (6301-6312). These buses are painted in a blue- and-gold REX paint scheme, all of which operate out of the Cinder Bed Road division. The original REX bus fleet consisted of twelve now-retired 2000 Orion VI buses (2073-2084). The 2000 Orion VI buses were wrapped in the REX scheme, instead of being painted. The second "REX" fleet consisted of 12 2006 Orion VII CNG buses (2674-2685). The Orion VII CNGs were the first set which is painted in the REX scheme, until they were all repainted between June and August 2014. The third "REX" fleet consisted of 12 2010 New Flyer DE40LFA diesel-electric hybrid buses (6550-6561) before being repainted back into the red local scheme. The REX has previously operated out of Four Mile Run division (2004-2014) and Shepherd Parkway divisions (2014-2018). ==History== REX began service on September 26, 2004. The REX takes over the southern portion of the 9A, which ran between Pentagon Station and Lorton VRE Station. The remaining portion of the 9A is provided by Fairfax Connector route 171, as the REX ends at Fort Belvoir. The fare of the initial REX route was $1.00, for a one-year demonstration period. The REX runs via the Jackson Loop at Fort Belvoir, although some trips alters via Pohick Road, when the Jackson Loop is closed. When the REX reaches Fort Belvoir, all customers that are on the REX follows the security procedure of Fort Belvoir, as the terminal is a military base. These procedures runs throughout all bus routes that serves Fort Belvoir. In 2008, the alternate terminal of the REX night trips was moved to Woodlawn at Old Mill Road. The night REX trips does not serve Fort Belvoir. In addition to these changes, the REX route adds a Saturday Supplemental trip, where it adds more trips on holiday, when REX runs on a Saturday schedule. The Saturday Supplemental trips operates up to Woodlawn, the same place where the night REX trips ends. Alongside with these changes, the special $1.00 fare was changed to the same fare as any regular Metrobus routes in January, 2009. In 2011, Fort Belvoir open doors to all REX trips, following the opening of Fort Belvoir Community Hospital. REX retained the full route until 2017, when the route is extended to the Fort Belvoir Post Exchange/Commissary. This extension is only effective during weekdays, as the REX does not operate at the Post Exchange/Commissary on the weekends. ==Service changes== Bus 2082, one of the 12 2000 Orion VI buses that were originally in the REX scheme until 2006. The REX does not change its main route since its opening, although times and stops were changed throughout time. Since the first time changes in the mid-2000s, REX adds more trips when there is a high demand in the route. ===August 2011 changes=== On August 7, 2011, the Fort Belvoir Community Hospital opened, opening the gates for 24 hours. The Fort Belvoir gates hour changes leads the night REX trips to discontinue the alternate routing service, which ends at Woodlawn. Service towards the Dewitt Hospital at Fort Belvoir was discontinued. ===June 2017 changes=== On June 25, 2017, the REX weekday service was extended to the Fort Belvoir Post Exchange/Commissary via Gunston Road. REX service to Jackson Loop was discontinued. Nearby stops will be served along Gunston Road at 5th Street. ==Future== In 2015, Fairfax County and WMATA plans to expand service through Richmond Highway. The major plans is to convert the REX route into a Bus rapid transit route, which the project is known as "Embark Richmond Highway." This project is to bring more service along Richmond Highway by extending service from Fort Belvoir up to Woodbridge. The idea of this project will add new stations, by widening Richmond Highway in order to make the dedicated stops for the new BRT route and the REX. == References == Category:2004 establishments in Virginia Category:Transport infrastructure completed in 2004 REX
