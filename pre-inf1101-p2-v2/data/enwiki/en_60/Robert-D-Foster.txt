Robert D. Foster (14 March 1811 - 1 February 1878) was a 19th-century physician and an early member of the Latter Day Saint movement, being baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints sometime before October 1839. ==Early life== Foster was born in Braunston, England. He was the son of John Foster and Jane Knibb. He was the brother of Charles A. Foster. Foster married Sarah Phinney on 18 July 1837 at Medina County, Ohio. ==Latter Day Saint movement== Foster was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints church sometime before October 1839 and was ordained an elder in October 1839, in Nauvoo, Illinois. Foster was mentioned by name in a revelation dated 19 January 1841, in which Joseph Smith states that Foster should build Smith a house in Nauvoo:Doctrine and Covenants 124:115. Foster built the resulting Mansion House, and the Smiths moved in 1843. Foster was appointed surgeon general in the Nauvoo Legion in March 1841 and he was a Regent of the University of Nauvoo from 1841 to 1844. Foster was excommunicated from the church on 18 April 1844, in Nauvoo. ==Nauvoo Expositor and death of Joseph Smith== After his excommunication, Foster became a publisher of the Nauvoo Expositor, which was critical of the church and Smith. Smith ordered the destruction of the press, leading to Smith's arrest and ultimately to his death. There is even evidence that Smith may have propositioned Foster's wife to become one of Smith's plural wives, but was turned down. Although, Foster's wife denied it multiple times, and only admitted it when he held a gun to her head.

Foster was an apostle in the break-away church formed by First Presidency member William Law. ==Later life== In 1850, Foster moved to Canandaigua, New York. In 1860, he moved to Loda, Illinois, where he died in 1878. ==References== Category:1811 births Category:1878 deaths Category:Converts to Mormonism Category:English emigrants to the United States Category:English Latter Day Saints Category:People excommunicated by the Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints) Category:People from Nauvoo, Illinois Category:Nauvoo Expositor publishers Category:Doctrine and Covenants people Category:19th-century English medical doctors Category:People from Iroquois County, Illinois Category:People from Braunston Category:19th-century American journalists Category:American male journalists
