, sometimes credited professionally as TAPPY, is a Japanese musical composer. He is best known for his contributions to the Metal Gear and Suikoden franchises. Iwase studied music with Dick Grove at the Grove School of Music prior to its closure in 1991. Iwase is credited with composing all of the music to the game Metal Gear Solid, with the exception being the ending theme "The Best Is Yet to Come". This includes the well-known main theme to Metal Gear Solid, arrangements of which were subsequently used in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. The use of his theme song was discontinued from Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of The Patriots onward due to allegations that its motifs were plagiarized from a classical piece by Russian composer Georgy Sviridov. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Japanese composers Category:Japanese male composers Category:Living people Category:Video game composers Category:Year of birth missing (living people)
