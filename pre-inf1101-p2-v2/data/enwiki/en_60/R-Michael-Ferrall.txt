R. Michael Ferrall (born October 3, 1936) is a former member of the Wisconsin State Assembly. ==Biography== Ferrall was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

From 1954 to 1957, Ferrall served in the United States Navy. He has five children. ==Political career== Ferrall was first elected to the Assembly in 1970. He is a Democrat. In two successive legislative sessions, Ferrall championed the "Ferrall bill" to establish a right to privacy in Wisconsin for the first time, making an invasion of the right to privacy and false light as causes of action under state law. In 1975, the Assembly passed the bill but the Senate failed to act on it.Privacy Bill Offered Again (Jan. 30, 1975), Milwaukee Journal. In 1977, the bill passed committee and was sent to the Assembly floor, but was delayed on a close vote; critics were concerned about a proliferation of lawsuits and media outlets were concerned about freedom of the press issues.Assembly Gets Altered Bill on Privacy Right (Mar. 9, 1977), Milwaukee Sentinel.Opponents Head Off Assembly Vote on Controversial Right to Privacy Bill (Apr. 13, 1977), Milwaukee Journal. In 1978, Ferrall became embroiled in a controversy over a $30 legislative per diem allowance he received while maintaining a house in Dane County, where the capital of Madison is situated. State law provided that legislators who maintained "primary residence" in Dane County were entitled only to half the maximum $30 per diem allowance. Ferrall was eventually cleared of wrongdoing in a report by Legislative Counsel staff attorneys.Eldon Knoche, Dane County Home, But Full Pay to Ferrall (July 27, 1978), Milwaukee Sentinel.Eldon Knoche, Finding Appears to Clear Ferrall (July 28, 1978), Milwaukee Sentinel.
