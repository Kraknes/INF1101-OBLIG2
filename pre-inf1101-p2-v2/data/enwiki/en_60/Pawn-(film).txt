Pawn is a 2013 American direct-to-video film directed by David A. Armstrong in his directorial debut. ==Plot== An old gangster, with a hard drive containing records of who he paid off, is targeted by a competition between dirty cops, internal affairs, etc. The dirty cops hire a thug to get into the safe (in the back of a diner) at midnight. But he brings his friends and goes too early for the time-release lock. Another crooked cop shows up (for uncertain reasons). The shooting ensues and during hostage negotiations the thug tries to put the blame onto an ex-con who just got out of jail, so that no one notices the real target is the hard drive. ==Cast== *Forest Whitaker as Will *Michael Chiklis as Derrick *Stephen Lang as Charlie *Ray Liotta as Man in the Suit *Nikki Reed as Amanda *Common as Jeff Porter *Marton Csokas as Lt Barnes *Max Beesley as Billy *Jonathan Bennett as Aaron *Nathan Parsons as Nypd Officer 1 *Aly Michalka as Nypd officer 2 *Cameron Denny as Nigel *Jessica Szohr as Bonnie *Matt Lanter as Rick *Jon Hamm as FBI Agent Mike *Mark Valley as FBI Agent *Sean Faris as Nick Davenport *Ronald Guttman as Yuri Mikelov *Jordan Belfi as Patrick ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2013 films Category:2013 crime drama films Category:American films Category:American crime drama films Category:English-language films Category:2013 directorial debut films Category:Films shot in Connecticut Category:2013 drama films
