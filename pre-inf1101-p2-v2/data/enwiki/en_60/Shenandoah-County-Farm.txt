Shenandoah County Farm, also known as the Shenandoah County Almshouse and Beckford Parish Glebe Farm, is a historic almshouse and poor farm located near Maurertown, Shenandoah County, Virginia. The almshouse was built in 1829, and is a large, brick Federal style institutional building. It consists of a two- story, five bay central section flanked by one-story, eight bay, flanking wings. A nearly identical building is at the Frederick County Poor Farm. A two-story, rear kitchen wing was added about 1850. Also on the property are the contributing stone spring house, a large modern frame barn (1952), a frame meat house (1894), a cemetery, and a portion of an American Civil War encampment site, occupied by Union troops prior to the Battle of Tom's Brook. and Accompanying photo It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.
