Richard Anthony McKenzie (born April 15, 1971) is a former American football linebacker. An All-American linebacker in high school, McKenzie starred at Penn State and left the team after the 1992 season though a dominant linebacker and considered by some to be the best athlete on that year's football team, Mckenzie was benched in the final bowl game after discipline issues with Coach Joe Paterno. As his off-the-field issues scared off many NFL teams, McKenzie was not selected until the sixth round of the 1993 NFL Draft. After three years and only eight game appearances he left the NFL. == References == Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:American football linebackers Category:Penn State Nittany Lions football players Category:Cleveland Browns players Category:Orlando Predators players Category:Chicago Rush players
