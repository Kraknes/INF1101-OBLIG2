In philosophy, to say that a statement is truth-apt is to say that it could be uttered in some context (without its meaning being altered) and would then express a true or false proposition.Simon Blackburn. The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy (2 rev. ed.) Oxford University Press. Truth-apt sentences are capable of being true or false, unlike questions or commands. Whether paradoxical sentences, prescriptions (especially moral claims), or attitudes are truth-apt is debated. ==See also== * Cognitivism (ethics) * Fictionalism * Non-cognitivism * Not even wrong * Truth-bearer ==References== Category:Truth Category:Concepts in logic Category:Meaning (philosophy of language) Category:Statements
