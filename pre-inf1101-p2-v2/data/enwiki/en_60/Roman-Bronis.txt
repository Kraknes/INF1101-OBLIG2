Roman Bronis (born 17 October 1976) is a Slovak road cyclist, who most recently rode for Slovakian amateur team TJ Slavia SG Trencin. He represented his nation Slovakia in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2008). ==Career== Born in Banovce nad Bebravou, Bronis made his official debut as an amateur cyclist at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he did not finish the men's road race against a vast field of more than a hundred cyclists. Bronis later turned professional in 2004, when he signed a two-year contract with Ed' System ZVVZ. Throughout his early sporting career, he competed for three annually contractual cycling teams (, , and ), and also produced numerous triumphs at different stages in both local and global road cycling tournaments, specifically in Coupe des Carpathes (Poland), Tour du Maroc (Morocco), Tour of Libya, and UAE International Emirates Post Tour. Eight years after competing in his last Olympics, Bronis qualified for his second Slovak squad, as a 33-year-old, in the men's road race at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing by receiving one of the team's three berths from the UCI Europe Tour, along with his teammates Matej Jurco and Jan Valach. Passing through the mark, Bronis could not achieve a best possible result with a severe fatigue under the Beijing's intense heat, as he failed to complete the race for the second straight time in his Olympic career. ==Major results== ;2001 : National Road Championships ::2nd Team time trial ::3rd Road race ;2002 : 1st Stage 1 Tour of Saudi Arabia : 3rd Team time trial, National Road Championships ;2003 : 1st Grand Prix Bradlo : 1st Stage 3 Grand Prix Cycliste de Gemenc : 2nd Coupe des Carpathes : 3rd Road race, National Road Championships ;2005 : 3rd Road race, National Road Championships ;2006 : 1st Overall Tour du Maroc : 1st Coupe des Carpathes ;2007 : 1st Overall Baltyk-Karkonosze Tour ;2008 : National Road Championships ::2nd Road race ::3rd Time trial : 2nd Overall Tour of Libya ::1st Stages 2, 3, 4 & 7 : 3rd Overall UAE International Emirates Post Tour ::1st Stage 4 : 3rd Overall Baltyk-Karkonosze Tour ;2009 : 1st 20px Time trial, National Road Championships : 9th Overall Okolo Slovenska ;2011 : 2nd Time trial, National Road Championships : 3rd Overall Course de Solidarnosc et des Champions Olympiques : 4th Overall Grand Prix Chantal Biya ;2012 : National Road Championships ::4th Road race ::5th Time trial ;2013 : 5th Road race, National Road Championships ;2016 : 3rd Time trial, National Road Championships : 5th Memorial Andrzeja Trochanowskiego ==References== ==External links== * * *NBC 2008 Olympics profile * Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Slovak male cyclists Category:Cyclists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic cyclists of Slovakia Category:People from Banovce nad Bebravou
