As its name implies, the size is increased by 10 mm to 660 mm from the original 650 mm of Zero 650 Quadcopter. In addition to slightly increased size, the other improvement of Zero 660 Quadcopter over the original Zero 650 Quadcopter is that the ground control station of Zero 660 Quadcopter is an android instead of specially dedicated bulky unit used for Zero 650 Quadcopter. Specification:Zero 660 Quadcopter *Endurance: 45 min *Deployment time: 5 min from storge to flight ==Zero 820== Zero 820 hexacopter is a multirotor developed by Zero Tech for aerial survey and surveillance missions, and it has been deployed by Chinese law enforcement authorities.Zero 820 Hexacopter *Size: 820 mm *Remote control radius: 5 km *Cruise speed: 10.2 m/s *Normal operating altitude: 1 km *Endurance: 20 min with full load *Max take-off weight: 6.6 kg *Max payload: 2 kg *Max wind scale (speed) allowed for operation: 5 (9 m/s) *Operating temperature: -20 to 50 degC *Storage temperature: -20 to 65 degC ==Zero 1200== Zero 1200 quadcopter is a multirotor developed by Zero Tech with carbon fiber construction to reduce empty weight and increase payload.
