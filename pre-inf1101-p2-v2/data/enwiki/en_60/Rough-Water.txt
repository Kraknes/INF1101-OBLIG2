"Rough Water" is a song by Travie McCoy featuring Jason Mraz. It was released digitally as a single on September 13, 2013 through Fueled by Ramen. ==Lyrics== The song is based on two lovers in a long distance relationship, where McCoy says they're on the same sphere despite 3 months apart, while Mraz sings the lines 'Never let go of me, Hold tight, It's gonna get hard to breathe" in an emotional hook. The song also features many references to the 1998 film Titanic, i.e. "loose lips sink ships, that's what someone told me, but this boat can stay afloat as long as you hold me". ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class="wikitable sortable plainrowheaders" style="text- align:center;" |- ! scope="col" | Chart (2013-14) ! scope="col" | Peak position |- |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:2013 singles Category:2013 songs Category:Travie McCoy songs Category:Jason Mraz songs
