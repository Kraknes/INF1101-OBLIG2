This film was dubbed in Hindi as Tiger: One Man Army. == Plot == Bala Subramanyam, alias Subbu (Jr. NTR) is a college student who is loved by each and everyone for his cool nature and lovable philosophy of keeping his head cool all the time. Neeraja (Sonali Joshi) is a Good Samaritan who keeps on donating money anonymously to fund 25 seats in the college in which Subbu is studying. Subbu is curious to know about the person who is donating that money. Subbu falls in love with Neeraja, mainly for her positive attitude. There is a strong reason for Neeraja to donate money to the college. There is a stronger reason for Subbu to become a cool-headed guy. In the flashback, Subbu rescues a girl who met with an accident and admits her into a hospital. She is a daughter of a rich industrialist, G. K. Chowdary. G. K. Chowdary misunderstands Subbu as the other Bala Subramanyam who is responsible for his daughter having become pregnant. Without knowing the truth, G. K. becomes the reason for the suicides of Subbu's entire family. G. K. realizes the truth later. And incidentally, Neeraja is the younger sister of the girl whom Subbu rescues. By the time of the interval, the audience realize that Subbu and Neeraja are in search of each other. The rest of the film twirls around how this couple realizes that they are made for each other, indeed. ==Cast== *Jr. NTR as Bala Subramanyam *Sonali Joshi as Neeraja *Brahmanandam *A. V. S. *M. S.

To put in a more frank way, people started accepting NTR as his number of films is increasing (remember the old adage - tinaga tinaga vemu teeyanundu)". Telugu cinema.com stated "The film is below the expectations in all the senses. Songs in New Zealand are ok. Other songs are not up to the mark". The movie was an average grosser at the box office. ==Soundtrack== The music was composed by Mani Sharma and released by Aditya Music. == References == == External links == * Category:Telugu-language films Category:Indian films Category:Telugu film scores by Mani Sharma
