Golino won a Globo d'oro for Best Breakthrough Actress for her performance in the film. == Plot summary == The Italian childhood fantasy Little Flames (Piccoli Fuochi) concerns 5-year-old Dino Jakosic. Proving too much for his parents, Jakosic is often sent to his room, where he interacts with several bizarre "imaginary" playmates who bedevil the servants with their sadistic pranks (the audience is never certain whether the playmates are real or whether the boy is pulling off the pranks himself). Valeria Golino plays Mara, the family's new maid, whom Jakosic takes a liking to. He begs his playmates to leave Mara alone, but out of jealousy they plan an awful revenge on the poor woman. == Cast == * Valeria Golino: Mara * Dino Jaksic: Tommaso * Ulisse Minervini: Franci * Carlotta Wittig: Ada * Mario Garriba: Leo * Daniela Giordano: * Simona Tedeschi: ==References== == External links == * * Piccoli Fuochi at Allmovie Category:1985 films Category:Italian films Category:Italian-language films Category:Italian drama films Category:Films directed by Peter Del Monte Category:Juvenile sexuality in films Category:Italian coming-of-age films
