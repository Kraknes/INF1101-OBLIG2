The Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2 (OAO-2, nicknamed Stargazer) was the first successful space telescope (first space telescope being OAO-1, which failed to operate once in orbit), launched on December 7, 1968. An Atlas- Centaur rocket launched it into a nearly circular altitude Earth orbit.Gunter - OAO-2 Data was collected in ultraviolet on many sources including comets, planets, and galaxies. It had two major instrument sets facing in opposite directions; the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) and the Wisconsin Experiment Package (WEP).Orbiting Astronomical Observatory OAO-2 One discovery was large halos of hydrogen gas around comets, and it also observed Nova Serpentis, which was a nova discovered in 1970. ==Celescope: Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory== The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, also called Celescope, had four 12 inch (30.5 cm) Schwarzschild telescopes that fed into Uvicons.High-Resolution Telescopes Various filters, photocathodes, and electronics aided in collecting data in several ultraviolet light passbands. The experiment was completed in April 1970. By the time it finished about 10 percent of the sky was observed. The Uvicon was an ultra-violet light detector based on the Westinghouse Vidicon. Ultraviolet light was converted into electrons which were in-turn converted to a voltage as those electrons hit the detection area of the tube. There has been a Uvicon in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution since 1973. == Wisconsin Experiment Package == The Wisconsin Experiment Package had eleven different telescopes for ultraviolet observations.Wisconsin Experiment Package For example, there was a photoelectric photometer fed by a 16-inch (40.64 cm) telescope with a six- position filter wheel. WEP observed over 1200 targets in ultraviolet light before the mission ended in early 1973. == Spacecraft bus == The observatory was overall about 10 ft by 7 in the shape of an octagonal prism and it weighed 4400 pounds. ==See also== * Orbiting Astronomical Observatory * Orbiting Solar Observatory ==References== ==External links== * OAO 2 observations of the Alpha Persei cluster *OAO-2 Info and pics *50th Anniversary Overview of OAO-2 including video Category:Ultraviolet telescopes Category:Spacecraft launched in 1968
