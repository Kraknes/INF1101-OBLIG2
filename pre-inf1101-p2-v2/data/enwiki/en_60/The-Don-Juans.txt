The Don Juans (, also known as Skirt Chasers) is a 2013 Czech comedy film directed by Jiri Menzel. The film was selected as the Czech entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. Originally Agnieszka Holland's mini-series Burning Bush had been selected to represent the Czech Republic. However AMPAS disqualified the film, citing regulations that the film must not have initially appeared on television. The mini-series aired on Czech TV eight months prior to the re-edited version that appeared in cinemas. The Don Juans was a controversial pick as members of the Czech Film Academy did not see the film before it was chosen and because the film was poorly received by Czech critics. ==Cast== * Jan Hartl as Vitek * Libuse Safrankova as Marketka * Martin Huba as Jakub * Jirina Jiraskova as Jirina * Ivana Chylkova as Adelka * Jan Jiran as Conductor * Vaclav Kopta as Otto * Eva Josefikova as young Marketka * Vaclav Jilek as young Jakub ==See also== * List of submissions to the 86th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film * List of Czech submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film ==References== ==External links== * Category:2013 films Category:2013 comedy films Category:Czech films Category:Czech-language films Category:Films directed by Jiri Menzel Category:Czech comedy films
