{| |} The Sarolea Albatros was a 22 kW (30 hp) flat twin air-cooled aircraft engine, produced just before World War II in Belgium. ==Design and development== In the 1930s, Sarolea were one of the biggest motorcycle producers in Europe, using their own engines. They also designed and built small flat twin engines for light aircraft. The Albatros dates from about 1938. It had chrome-nickel steel machined piston barrels, with closely spaced cooling fins. The cylinder heads were aluminium alloy, with hemispherical combustion chambers and bronze valve seats. The connecting rods had big and little ends with roller bearings. The crankshaft was a chrome nickel steel forging, running in a combination of roller and ball bearings; a ball bearing at the output side crankshaft end allowed the Albatros to be used in either pusher or tractor configuration. With a maximum power of only at 2,650 rpm, the Abatros was targeted at the small single seat sports aircraft of the day. ==Applications== These types were also fitted, or planned to be fitted with other small engines. * Kocjan Bak II * Scibor-Rylski SR-3 * Tipsy S.2 ==Engines on display== * A Sarolea Albatros is on display at Old Warden in the Shuttleworth Collection. ==Specifications== ==References== Category:Flat engines Category:1930s aircraft piston engines Category:Air-cooled aircraft piston engines
