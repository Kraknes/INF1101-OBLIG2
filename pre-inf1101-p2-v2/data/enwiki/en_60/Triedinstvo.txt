Triedinstvo (, , meaning Triune in English) is a three-way split CD by the Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian bands Kolovrat, Arya Varta and Kamaedzitca. The album took a year to complete and was released in 2012. According to the album's liner notes, the album was originally conceived in 2001 and meant to be released in 2003, but unspecified circumstances held it back. The aim of the album is to promote unity and solidarity between the Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians. The liner notes also speak out against pseudo-nationalists and chauvinists.
