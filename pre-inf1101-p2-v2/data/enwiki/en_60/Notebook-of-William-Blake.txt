"I asked a thief to steal me a peach...", "I heard an Angel singing...", A Cradle Song (Blake, 1794) and Christian Forbearance (the draft of "A Poison Tree") The Notebook of William Blake (also known as the Rossetti Manuscript from its association with its former owner Dante Gabriel Rossetti) was used by William Blake as a commonplace book from (or 1793) to 1818. ==Description== The Notebook [Butlin #201] consists of 58 leaves and contains autograph drafts by Blake of poems and prose with numerous sketches and designs, mostly in pencil. Containing two pages of preface, alongside 94 pages of sketches, each page is approximately 159 x 197mm. The original leaves were later bound with a partial copy (ff. 62-94) of 'All that is of any value in the foregoing pages' that is Rossettis' transcription of Blake's notebook (added after 1847).See: Rossetti Manuscript online: 1 2 Ideas of Good & Evil, p.4 == Ideas of Good & Evil == At first the Notebook belonged to Blake's favourite younger brother and pupil Robert who made a few pencil sketches and ink-and-wash drawings in it. After death of Robert in February 1787, Blake inherited the volume beginning it with the series of sketches for many emblematic designs on a theme of life of a man from his birth to death. Then, reversing the book he wrote on its last pages a series of poems of . He continued the book in 1800s returning to the first pages. All together the Notebook contains about 170 poems plus fragments of prose: Memoranda (1807), Draft for Prospectus of the Engraving of Chaucer's Canterbury Pilgrims (1809), Public Address (1810), A Vision of the Last Judgment (1810). The latest work in the Notebook is a long and elaborated but unfinished poem The Everlasting Gospel dated c. 1818. On the page 4 is placed a short humorous poem "When a Man has Married a Wife..." and a picture above showing of a man and woman rising from bed in a sparsely furnished room that could be Blake's own. The line of text obscured by the picture "Ideas of Good & Evil" served probably as a title to 64 following picture emblems, 17 of which were used for the book "For Children: The Gates of Paradise". D. G. Rossetti,D. G. Rossetti (in Gilchrist, 1863/1880). A. C. Swinburne,Swinburne, 1868. and W. B. YeatsYeats, 1893/1905. in their publications of Blake's poetry used this as a title for the series of poems from the manuscripts. In 1905 John Sampson issued the first annotated publication of all these poems and created a detailed descriptive Index to 'The Rossettt MS.'.Sampson, 1905. It follows by some other scholarly publications edited by Geoffrey Keynes (1935 & 1957/66), David V. Erdman (1965/82/88) & together with D. K. Moore (1977), Alicia Ostriker (1977), Gerald E. Bentley Jr. (1977), etc. In the introduction of his publication D. G. Rossetti gave to these poems a following presentation: == Poems of 1793== The section of contains 63 poems that include drafts versions of 16 poems entered the collection of Songs of Experience, which have been placed here in the following order: The Tyger (1st draft)", p.109 {| |Poems and fragments from the Note-book || Pages: || See related texts in the Songs of Experience: |- |Written about 1793 (numbering from ed.

Also it is interesting to compare the most famous Blake's poem "The Tyger" with its two earlier Notebook versions (see: "The Tyger", 1st draft and 2nd draft). The genre of most of the poems of this section can be defined as Songs and Ballads. Some of them reflect the political and social climate of that time: Why should I care for the men of Thames...", p.113 rev Silent, Silent Night...", p.113 rev   Some other of these poems rather belong to the genre of Satiric verses and epigrams, like the following: Motto to the Songs of Innocence and of Experience, p.101 rev Motto to the Songs of Innocence and of Experience This motto, which was never engraved by Blake, is not found in any copy of the Songs of Innocence and of Experience. == Poems of 1800-1803== Mock on, Mock on, Voltaire, Rousseau, p.7 There are 10 poems in the Notebook written during Blake's life in Felpham, a village in West Sussex. Here is the one of his most characteristic poems of that period:  == Poems of 1808-1811== The most of 92 texts of this section are epigrams, gnomic verses or fragments addressed to Blake's friends and enemies, to painters and poets as well as some different historical or mythological characters and even to God. Here are typical examples: "Was I angry with Hayley who us'd me so ill...", p.23 To God", p.73 "The Angel that presided o'er my birth...", p.32 "I give you the end of a golden string...", p.46  To God In the following short fragment Blake speaks of himself and his own spiritual experience in his babyhood:  There is also a draft of famous Blake's motto from his poem Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion:  But there in "Jerusalem" at the beginning of the chapter 4 ("To the Christians") it is given in a combination with other 4 mysterious lines: {| |- |Devils are ||I give you the end of a golden string, |- |False Religions ||Only wind it into a ball: |- |"Saul Saul" ||It will lead you in at Heavens gate, |- |"Why persecutest thou me." ||Built in Jerusalems wall. |- |} ==Designs== The Notebook is full of Blake's sketches and designs almost on every page.
