Arab was asked to represent Canada at the International Conference on Women in Politics, held in Amman, Jordan in May 2016. The conference was the first of its kind to be held in a Middle East North African country and united female Parliamentarians from across the world to engage in discussion about the importance of female decision-makers in today's global society. In 2017, Arab was actively involved in supporting the Equal Voice Initiative-Daughters of the Vote, which invites one young women between the ages of 18-23 from every federal riding in Canada to represent their community and communicate their vision for Canada.
