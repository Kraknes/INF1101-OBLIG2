Yuri Petrovich Raizer ( in Kharkiv, USSR) is a prominent Soviet and Russian theoretical physicist. He received his PhD degree in 1953 and his Doctor of Sciences degree in 1959. He is Senior Research Fellow with Ishlinsky Institute for Problems in Mechanics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia where he has been serving as a head of the Division of Physics of gas dynamic processes since 1965. Additionally, he has been professor at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology since 1968. Professor Yuri P. Raizer has worked in various fields including gas dynamics, low-temperature plasma, explosion physics, gas discharge physics, the interaction of laser radiation with ionized gas, and the physics of lightning. He has written over 200 papers, 8 books (6 in English), and 3 patents. His "Physics of Shock Waves and High-Temperature Hydrodynamic Phenomena", co-authored with Yakov B. Zel'dovich (in English, 1968, 2002), and "Gas Discharge Physics" (in English, 1991, 1997) are well known handbooks for researchers and students. == Bibliography == *Ya. B. Zel'dovich, Yu. P. Raizer.
