Thulcandra recorded a demo called Perishness Around Us in 2004, but neither were satisfied with its quality and did not release it. Shortly thereafter guitarist Jurgen Zintz committed suicide in 2005. Thus the band then went on hold. Upon moving to another city in late 2008 Steffen Kummerer started listening to their first demo after many years, and decided to restart the band. The name of the band is taken from a 1989 demo of the Norwegian act Darkthrone, coming from the 1938 science fiction novel Out of the Silent Planet by C. S. Lewis, where Thulcandra is the name for the silent planet, Earth. ==Members== ===Current members=== *Steffen Kummerer - guitars & vocals (2002-2005, 2008-present) *Alessandro Delastik - drums (2014-present) *Mariano Delastik - guitars (2018-present) *Christian Kratzer - bass (2018-2020, died in 2020) ===Former members=== *Jurgen Zintz - guitars (2003-2005; died 2005) *Jonas Baumgartl - drums (2003-2005) *Seraph - drums (2008-2015) *Sebastian Ludwig - guitars (2008-2017) *Tobias Ludwig - bass (2008-2017) ==Discography== ===Studio Albums=== * Fallen Angel's Dominion (2010) * Under a Frozen Sun (2011) * Ascension Lost (2015) ===Demo=== * Perishness Around Us (2004) ===Music video=== * The Second Fall (2015) ==References== http://highwiredaze.com/wordpress/thulcandrain2 http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Thulcandra/126757 ==External links== *Official Thulcandra Homepage Category:German black metal musical groups Category:Napalm Records artists Category:Musical groups established in 2003 Category:2003 establishments in Germany
