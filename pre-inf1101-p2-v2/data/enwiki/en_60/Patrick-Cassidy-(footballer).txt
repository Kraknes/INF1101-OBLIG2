His defensive partnership with Billy Hardy and Kidder Harvey led the trio to be given the nickname of the "holy three" by the club fans. The emergence of a young Fred Keenor following the end of World War I saw Cassidy come under pressure for his place in the side and, following Keenor's strong performances during pre- season matches prior to 1919-20 season, Cassidy himself pushed for Keenor to be included in the first-team in his place due to his "youth and promise". ==Honours== ;Cardiff City *Southern Football League Second Division winner: 1912-13 ==Sources== * ==References== Category:1887 births Category:Year of death missing Category:English footballers Category:South Shields F.C.
