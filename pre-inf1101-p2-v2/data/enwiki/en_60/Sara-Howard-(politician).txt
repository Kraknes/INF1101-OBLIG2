Gwen Howard served two terms in the Nebraska Legislature, representing the 9th District in midtown Omaha. Because of Nebraska's term-limits law, she was ineligible to run for a third consecutive term in the 2012 election. Sara Howard, who had been her mother's campaign manager, ran for the seat. In the nonpartisan primary, Howard received 56.6% of the vote; Erica Fish, 30.1%; and Vernon Joseph Davis, 13.3%. As the top two vote-getters, Howard, a member of the Democratic Party, and Fish, a Republican, moved on to the general election. Howard won the seat, with 66% of the vote to Fish's 34%. In the Legislature's 2015 session, Howard was appointed to the Banking, Commerce, and Insurance Committee, and to the Health and Human Services Committee. ==References== ==External links== *Vote Smart page *"State Sen.
