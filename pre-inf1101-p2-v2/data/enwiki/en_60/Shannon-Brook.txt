The Shannon Brook, a perennial stream of the Richmond River catchment, is located in Northern Rivers region in the state of New South Wales, Australia. ==Location and features== Formed by the confluence of the Theresa Creek and Deep Creek, Shannon Brook rises on the Richmond Range about southwest of Mummulgum. The river flows generally northeast, east southeast and east, joined by two minor tributaries before reaching its confluence with the Richmond River near Tatham, about southeast of Casino. The river descends over its course. ==Etymology== The river is believed to be named in honour of J. C. Shannon who came from the Clarence Valley and took up Stratheden for Dr. John Dobie in 1842. He camped by the creek, hence the name Shannon Brook. J. C. Shannon was known locally as Doc Shannon. ==See also== * Rivers of New South Wales * List of rivers of New South Wales (L-Z) * List of rivers of Australia ==References== ==External links== * Category:Northern Rivers Category:Rivers of New South Wales
