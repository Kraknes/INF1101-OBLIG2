In Turkic mythology, a Sazakan is a dragon, hawk, falcon, or fiery dwarf who turns himself into a whirlwind. The entity causes storms. Sazakan is a spirit associated with bringing rain and hail. His influence on these precipitations can be positive, resulting with the amount of rain beneficial for agriculture, or negative, with a drought, downpours, or hail. Sazakans also have power over wind, which they use to intensify storms. Sazakans live around hills, mountains, and high mounds; in the wilderness; and sometimes in the clouds. In Nogai folklore, Sazakans are described as being noisy spirits, and are the patron of the clouds. ==Sources== * Turk Mitoloji Sozlugu, Pinar Karaca - "Sazakan" ==External links== * Gizemli Ilimler - Sazakan * Kayip Dunya, Turk Mitolojisi Sozlugu - "Sazakan" Category:Turkic legendary creatures
