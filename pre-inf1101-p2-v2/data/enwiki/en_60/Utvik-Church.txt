Utvik Church () is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Stryn Municipality in Vestland county, Norway. It is located in the village of Utvik. It is the church for the Utvik parish which is part of the Nordfjord prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjorgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1840 by the architect Hans Linstow. The church seats about 350 people. ==History== The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1330, but the church was not new at that time, but rather it was likely built in the 13th century. The medieval stave church apparently existed until the early 17th century. In 1617, a new cruciform church was built to replace the previous church. It was in use until 1840 when it was torn down and it was replaced on the same site with a new building. The new building was designed in a neo-gothic style. The building was consecrated on 29 November 1840. ==Media gallery== Utvik kyrkje.jpg Utvik.jpg Utvik kyrkje 01.JPG Utvik kyrkje 04.JPG ==See also== *List of churches in Bjorgvin ==References== Category:Stryn Category:Churches in Vestland Category:Wooden churches in Norway Category:19th-century Church of Norway church buildings Category:Churches completed in 1840 Category:13th- century establishments in Norway
