The following year he was back on the frontline of the Serbian defence, this time against Bulgaria, where he was wounded near Kriva Palanka. Together with the last class of cadets-corporals, he left the military academy in 1914 and went straight to the front to fight the Austro-Hungarian Empire. For much of 1914 he, much to his frustration, was assigned to Pirot which was far from the front.Zivot coveka na Balkanu, 3rd Edition, Stanislav Krakov, p63 In 1915 he participated in many battles, survived the Serbian army's retreat through Albania, and was one of the first who reached the top of the impregnable Kajmakcalan.
