Nobel Moral electrically powered UAVs are Chinese UAVs developed by Shenyang Noble Moral Aviation (Noble Moral, Chen Yang Tong Fei Hang Kong Ke Ji You Xian Gong Si ), which originally had jointly developed several unmanned helicopters with Tianjin University and Shenyang Institute of Automation (SYIA, Chen Yang Zi Dong Hua Yan Jiu Suo ) of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Based on the experience gained from these projects, Nobel Moral has since developed numerous unmanned helicopters of its own. The general designer of these UAV are Mr. Liu Bin (Liu Bin ), who is also the founder of the company.general designer ==1.5 m class UAV== 1.5 m class UAV is an unmanned helicopter developed by Nobel Moral and when it was first completed, it was the largest electrically powered unmanned helicopter in China. Development was completed in April 2006 and went into service with another Chinese UAV developer, Shenyang Institute of Automation (SYIA) of Chinese Academy of Sciences, which eventually developed unmanned helicopter of its own. Specification: *Length (m): 1.55 *Width (m): 0.55 *Height (m): 0.55 *Power plant: lithium batteries ==450 class UAV== 450 class UAV is an unmanned helicopter developed by Nobel Moral for aerial photography. Development was completed in February 2009 and the UAV has been in service since. The UAV is mainly used for indoor televised events such as sports and conventions. Specification: *Length (m): 0.85 *Width (m): 0.3 *Height (m): 0.33 *Power plant: lithium batteries ==Bell helicopter drone== Bell Helicopter drone is drone is an unmanned helicopter developed by Nobel Moral originally for airshows, but has been adopted by Chinese military for training of the air defense force. The drone is mainly used to provide realistic visual identification training of the ground force and air crews. The fuselage is constructed of plastic and the rotor is constructed of fiber glass. Specification: *Length (m): 1 *Width (m): 0.4 *Height (m): 0.3 *Power plant: lithium batteries ==Plateau Heroic Eagle== Plateau Heroic Eagle (Gao- Yuan Xiong-Ying, Gao Yuan Xiong Ying ) unmanned helicopter is an unmanned coaxial helicopter developed by Noble Moral specifically for operation in high elevation. This unmanned helicopter is constructed of LY16 aerospace aluminum, and it can be recovered via parachute without discarding the rotor. Specification: * Length (m): 1.8 * Take-off weight (kg): 25 ==See also== List of unmanned aerial vehicles of the People's Republic of China ==References== Category:Unmanned helicopters of China
