Tanah Abang, sometimes written as Tanahabang Station (THB) is a train station located in Kampung Bali, Tanah Abang. This station located to the east of West Flood Canal. The station and the canal are only separated by a small, narrow embankment and as such, Tanah Abang station is prone to flooding, especially during the heavy rain season. Tanah Abang station serves as the terminus for KA Commuter Line Tanah Abang-Rangkasbitung. It used to serve some intercity services, but after the opening of Rangkasbitung railway station, all local train services towards Merak use Rangkasbitung station as their terminus, therefore local train services do not stop in Tanah Abang station anymore. The history of Tanahabang station was date back from 1899 railway line Jakarta-Anyer Kidul. The first segment, Jakarta-Tanahabang-Rangkasbetung (currently Rangkasbitung) was opened on 1 October 1899 according to State Railway Company of the Dutch East Indies' 1921, 1925 and 1932 Annual Report. This station, alongside Duri railway station, serves as transfer stations for the only train services towards South Tangerang and Tangerang respectively. As commuters from these two satellite cities need to change train here before going to other places in Jakarta, these two stations tend to be crowded especially in rush hour. Tanah Abang locomotive depot is located north of the station. == Train services == * KRL Loop line: from Jatinegara to Bogor via Duri * KRL Serpong line: from Tanahabang to Rangkasbitung Defunct services * Kalimaya intercity (Merak-Tanahabang) closed 1 April 2017 * Patas Merak intercity (Merak-Angke via Tanahabang) closed 1 April 2017 * Rangkas Jaya intercity (Tanahbang-Rangkasbitung) closed 1 April 2017 * Krakatau intercity (Merak-Kediri via Tanahabang) closed 17 July 2017.
