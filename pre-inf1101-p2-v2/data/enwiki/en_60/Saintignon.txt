Saintignon coat of arms The family of Saintignon is a surviving family of the French nobility, a Lotharingian noble family from Verdun, who rose to prominence and solidified their place in the royal courts under the Ancien Regime. An extinct branch was titled Baron of the Holy Empire in 1746. He owned a regiment in his name in the Austrian army, the Saintignon-dragons, from 1759 to 1779. During the Industrial Revolution, the family of Saintignon invested in steel factories in Lorraine (under the name De Saintignon and Co.). ==History== According to tradition, Jehan Saincte came from the Verdun family of De la Porte, and is supposed to have defended Castle Viumbay successfully against Jacques de Revigny in 1293. Heavily injured, he cried out "d'Ugnon, d'Ugnon", and this cry became his name . Ancherin Sainctignon (died before 1439), alderman of Verdun, married to Jeanne Pierxel, whose son also named Ancherin, esquire, alderman of Verdun, married to Jeanne de Chauldeney, in 1498. It is this date of 1498 that Regis Valette retains in his catalog of the French nobility in the twenty-first century, as the date of the nobility of the family of Saintignon. Claude-Martin Saugrain wrote in 1726, the Saintignons were the most respected family of Verdun due to their age and numerous charitable gifts. ==Notable members== *Antonia Luzia of Saintignon, Abbess of Differdange *Eric de Saintignon (1630-1699), lord at Villers-le- Preudhomme *Johann Franz Graf von Saint-Ignon, (died 1745, wounded at Hohenfriedberg).
