"Timber" is a song by American rapper Pitbull featuring American singer Kesha. The song was released on October 6, 2013, as the lead single from Pitbull's extended play (EP) Meltdown EP. The song was produced by Dr. Luke, Cirkut, and Sermstyle, with additional production by Nick Seeley. The song interpolates Lee Oskar's 1978 single "San Francisco Bay" and features harmonica player Paul Harrington, who plays through the entire song and was told to emulate Oskar. The song peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks, with 442,000 single week downloads sold. It also topped the charts in over fifteen countries, including Canada (where it stood at No. 1 for eight consecutive weeks), Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. According to the IFPI, the song sold 12.6 million units worldwide in 2014, including single-track downloads and track-equivalent streams, becoming the sixth best-selling song of that year. As of 2019, the song has now sold 19.1 million copies worldwide. ==Background and composition== Kesha had previously featured Pitbull on remixes of her songs "Tik Tok" and "Crazy Kids", and Pitbull has featured Kesha on a 2009 song, "Girls". In an interview in December 2013, Pitbull said that Rihanna was originally meant to be the featured artist on "Timber", but she had already been asked to be the featured artist on Shakira's "Can't Remember to Forget You" and did not have time to record "Timber". "Timber" is a dance-pop, EDM and folktronica song with elements of country. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a moderately fast tempo of 130 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of G minor and follows a chord sequence of Gm-B-F-E. Kesha's vocals span from G#3 to D#5. Paul Harrington, who plays the harmonica throughout the track, was initially given a flat fee of $1,000 for his services. Three years later, however, after consulting an expert on music law, Harrington was paid a further $50,000. ==Chart performance== "Timber" made its first chart appearance on October 10, 2013, in the Republic of Ireland, where it debuted at number 67 on the Irish Singles Chart.

The music video has over 1.2 billion views on YouTube as of May 2020, making it his most viewed video as a lead artist. ==Controversy== On June 25, 2014, it was reported that songwriters Lee Oskar, Keri Oskar, and Greg Errico had filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the makers of "Timber", which features a harmonica melody that Oskar claims is "identical" to the melody used in his 1978 song "San Francisco Bay". The songwriters were seeking $3 million USD in damages. The lawsuit alleges that while Sony Music may have obtained permission to use the sample, which is credited in the album notes for Meltdown, from a license holder, the label failed to obtain permission from the songwriters themselves. ==Track listing== *;Digital download #"Timber" (featuring Kesha) - 3:24 *;CD single #"Timber" (featuring Kesha) - 3:24 #"Outta Nowhere" (featuring Danny Mercer) - 3:26 ==Credits and personnel== ;Recording *Engineered in Tokyo, Japan, and at APG Studios, Hollywood, California; Conway Recording Studios, Hollywood, California; Luke's in the Boo, Malibu, California; Jungle City Studios, New York City, New York, and Blackbird Recording Studios, Nashville, Tennessee ;Personnel *Armando C.
