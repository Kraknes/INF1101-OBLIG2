Black and Ryan J. Owens, Elevation Adaptation: How Circuit Judges Alter Their Behavior for Promotion to the Supreme Court ("Gaille (1997) analyzed the amount of articles circuit court judges published before and after the Bork hearings, finding that circuit court judges authored significantly fewer articles after the Bork debacle than they did before it. What is more, judges authored significantly fewer articles mentioning "race" or "abortion" in the aftermath of the Bork hearing. Simply put, circuit court judges who harbored ambitions for elevation to the Supreme Court made the strategic calculation to publish fewer articles, articles that might later be used against them.) * Richard Posner, How Judges Think * Lee Epstein, William M.
