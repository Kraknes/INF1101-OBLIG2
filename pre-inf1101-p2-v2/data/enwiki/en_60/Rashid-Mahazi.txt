Mahazi's grand final debut came the week later on 17 May 2015 against Sydney FC, being substituted on for Gui Finkler at the 87th minute. ====2015-16==== With the offseason departure of Mark Milligan, and with captain Carl Valeri ruled out for the majority of the season due to medical reasons, Mahazi featured in 23 of the Victory's 28 A-League matches, starting 16 times. Mahazi featured in the 2015 FFA Cup Final victory against Perth Glory, being substituted on at the 84th minute for Guilherme Finkler.

Following the departure of marquee Oliver Bozanic, Mahazi became a regular fixture in midfield to the dismay of supporters, who were critical of his first touch and passing skills. In the regular season's conclusion, Mahazi made thirteen appearances including five starts. In the final series, Mahazi was an unused substitute in both the semi and grand final matches, but was awarded runners up medal. It is believed in the grand final that Kevin Muscat planned to have Mahazi be substituted on for captain Carl Valeri but was averted following the contraction of a migraine in the pre game warm up.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/football/a-league/studs-up-rashid-mahazi- to-quit-football-as-rhys-williams-move-to-melbourne-victory-looms/news- story/94aeccc5c27b331a59c062ef5e9535e3 Days after the club's loss in the grand final, it was reported that Mahazi was planning to take hiatus from the sport for personal reasons, reportedly turning down a renewal offer from Melbourne as well as two other offers from unnamed clubs.
