"Under Control" is a song recorded by Calvin Harris and Alesso, featuring vocals from Theo Hutchcraft, credited to his duo Hurts. The song was released on 7 October 2013 as the first single from Harris's fourth studio album, Motion (2014), and the second single from Alesso's debut studio album, Forever (2015). "Under Control" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart with first-week sales of 74,704 copies, becoming Harris's fifth number-one single, and the first for Alesso and Hurts. ==Background== "Under Control" was premiered on 2 August 2013 during a DJ set by Alesso at Ushuaia, Ibiza, which was broadcast by BBC Radio 1. Harris performed the song at the end of his set at the V Festival on 20 August. On 18 September, Harris posted a preview of the song on SoundCloud. The cover was unveiled on Alesso's Twitter page on 4 October. ==Music video== On 9 September 2013, Harris stated on Facebook that 1,000 fans would take a part in the music video shoot. Later a message was reposted by Alesso and Theo Hutchcraft from Hurts in a blog on Twitter. The video was shot in Los Angeles on 10 and 11 September. On the second day of the shoot, already with the fans, filming was held at the 6th Street Bridge, for an EDM concert held by the song's artists celebrating the end of the world. The world didn't actually end in the video because the meteor failed to hit the Earth. The video was uploaded to Harris's Vevo account on 21 October 2013 and has over 190 million views. ==Track listings== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from CD single liner notes. * Alesso - all instruments, engineering, mixing, production, songwriting * Calvin Harris - all instruments, engineering, mixing, production, songwriting * Theo Hutchcraft - vocals, songwriting * Mike Marsh - mastering ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class="wikitable sortable plainrowheaders" style="text-align:center" |- !scope="col"|Chart (2013-14) !scope="col"|Peak position |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row"|Australia Dance (ARIA) |6 |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row"|Netherlands (Mega Dance Top 30) |12 |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- ! scope="row"| Poland (Video Chart) | align=center| 3 |- |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- ! scope="row"| Slovenia (SloTop50) | align=center|23 |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |- !scope="row" |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class="wikitable sortable plainrowheaders" style="text- align:center" |- !scope="col"|Chart (2013) !scope="col"|Position |- !scope="row"|Australia Dance (ARIA) |33 |- !scope="row"|Belgium Dance (Ultratop Wallonia) |98 |- !scope="row"|Hungary (Dance Top 40) |55 |- ! scope="row"| Russia Airplay (Tophit) |style="text-align:center;"| 171 |- !scope="row"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |114 |- !scope="row"|US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs (Billboard) |90 |- !scope="col"|Chart (2014) !scope="col"|Position |- !scope="row"|Belgium Dance (Ultratop Flanders) |91 |- !scope="row"|Belgium Dance (Ultratop Wallonia) |85 |- !scope="row"|Hungary (Single Top 40) |72 |- !scope="row"|Italy (FIMI) |94 |- ! scope="row"| Russia Airplay (Tophit) |style="text-align:center;"| 54 |- !scope="row"|Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) |83 |- !scope="row"|US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs (Billboard) |56 |- !scope="col"|Chart (2019) !scope="col"|Position |- ! scope="row"| Portugal (AFP) | 2573 |} ==Certifications== !scope="col" colspan="3"| Streaming |- ==Release history== {| class="wikitable plainrowheaders" |- !scope="col"| Region !scope="col"| Date !scope="col"| Format(s) !scope="col"| Label !scope="col"| |- !scope="row"| France |rowspan="2"| 7 October 2013 |rowspan="4"| Digital download |rowspan="3"| Sony |align="center"| |- !scope="row"| Sweden |align="center"| |- !scope="row"| Australia | 11 October 2013 |align="center"| |- !scope="row"| United States | 22 October 2013 | Columbia |align="center"| |- !scope="row"| United Kingdom | 30 October 2013 | Contemporary hit radio | |align="center"| |- !scope="row"| Germany | 15 November 2013 |rowspan="3"| Digital download | Sony |align="center"| |- !scope="row"| Ireland | 22 November 2013 |rowspan="2"| |align="center"| |- !scope="row"| United Kingdom | 24 November 2013 |align="center"| |- !scope="row"| Germany | 3 January 2014 | CD single | Sony |align="center"| |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2013 singles Category:2013 songs Category:Alesso songs Category:Calvin Harris songs Category:Columbia Records singles Category:Synth-pop ballads Category:Hurts songs Category:Songs written by Calvin Harris Category:Number-one singles in Scotland Category:UK Dance Singles Chart number-one singles Category:UK Singles Chart number-one singles
