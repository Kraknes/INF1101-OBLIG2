Racuchy topped with powdered sugar Racuchy (pronounced ) is a traditional Polish dish from the same family of foods as the crepe and similar to American pancakes. Racuchy is made from some flour, milk, eggs, sugar and a pinch of salt. Racuchy are made with yeast or, in other versions, baking powder or baking soda. Racuchy are pan fried in oil. In Poland, racuchy are usually eaten as dinner, snack or supper. Racuchy can be eaten plain, sprinkled with sugar, or topped with powdered sugar. In alternative versions some cream or sour cream can be used. In some regions, racuchy are prepared more savoury and served with fish soup or mushroom soup during the Christmas Eve dinner. ==Stuffed racuchy== The most popular version of racuchy is stuffed with slices of apple and served with sugar. Sometimes, in more modern versions, other fruits can be used, for instance, bananas. There is also a savoury sweet version of stuffed racuchy, filled with potatoes. ==See also== * Ruchanki * List of stuffed dishes ==References== ==External links== * Category:Christmas food Category:Pancakes Category:Polish desserts Category:Stuffed dishes
