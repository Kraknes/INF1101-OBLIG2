The ThinkPad Yoga is a 2-in-1 convertible business-oriented tablet from Lenovo unveiled in September at the 2013 IFA in Berlin, Germany. It was released in the United States in November 2013. ==Design and performance== The ThinkPad Yoga series laptops has a "backlit" keyboard that flattens when flipped into tablet mode. This is accomplished with a platform surrounding the keys rises until level with the keyboard buttons, a locking mechanism that prevents key presses, and feet that pop out to prevent the keyboard from directly resting on flat surfaces. Lenovo implemented this design in response to complaints about its earlier Ideapad Yoga 13 and 11 models being awkward to use in tablet mode. A reinforced hinge was required to implement this design. Other than its convertible form factor, the first ThinkPad Yoga is a rather standard ThinkPad device with a black magnesium-reinforced chassis, island keyboard, a red TrackPoint, and a large buttonless trackpad (but trackpad have been upgraded to a mechanical 3-button version for a next generations of Yoga line). ==Models== {| class="wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="min-width: 75%; font-size: 80%;" ! colspan="11" style="text-align:center;" |Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 2013-2020 |- ! ! colspan="2" |Type !2013 !2014 !2015 !2016 !2017 !2018 !2019 !2020 |- |11.6" | rowspan="8" |Flipbook <<2-in-1>> |Affordable ! |Yoga 11e ! |Yoga 11e Gen2 |Yoga 11e Gen3 |Yoga 11e Gen4 |Yoga 11e Gen5 |11e Yoga Gen6 |- |12" | rowspan="4" |Mainstream | colspan="2" |Yoga (Yoga 12) | colspan="2" |Yoga 260 ! colspan="4" | |- | rowspan="2" |13" ! colspan="4" rowspan="2" | | rowspan="2" |Yoga 370 |L380 Yoga |L390 Yoga |L13 Yoga |- |X380 Yoga |X390 Yoga |X13 Yoga |- | rowspan="3" |14" ! | colspan="2" |Yoga 14 |460 Yoga ! colspan="4" | |- |Sub-premium ! colspan="3" | |X1 Yoga Gen1 |X1 Yoga Gen2 |X1 Yoga Gen3 |X1 Yoga Gen4 |X1 Yoga Gen5 |- |Mobile workstation ! colspan="3" | |P40 Yoga ! colspan="4" | |- |15" |Mainstream ! |S5 Yoga 15 ! colspan="6" | |- | colspan="11" |Non-Yoga series Thinkpad flipbook: |- |14" | |Premium ! colspan="3" | |X1 Carbon Gen4 ! colspan="4" | |} === Zero generation (2013) === ==== Thinkpad Yoga (S1 Yoga 12) ==== The first ThinkPad Yoga has a 12.5-inch IPS touchscreen with 1080p resolution. The screen was designed for use with an optional pen-style digitizer. It is powered by Haswell processors from Intel. Buyers are able to choose standard 2.5" hard drives or SSD, and additional M.2 SSD, but have a non-replaceable battery and soldered RAM. {| class="wikitable" style="font-size: 80%; text-align: center; min-width: 80%;" |- !

The memory can be upgraded up to 8GB. Unlike the Chromebook variant, the components of this version can be upgraded. ====Yoga 11e Chromebook==== The ThinkPad 11e is a Chromebook that has a matte black chassis with reinforced hinges and corners, a sturdy lid, and a rubber bumper protecting its display in order to help it survive accidental dropping, spills, and general rough handling. It uses a quad-core Intel Celeron CPU, has 4 GB of RAM which can not be upgraded, an 11.6 inch screen, and 16GB of eMMC flash storage. Reviewers claim it is somewhat heavier than a typical Chromebook with a weight of 3.1 pounds. This is likely because of its ruggedized and reinforced chassis. It uses typical ThinkPad-style keyboard with customized Chrome OS keys. It does not have Trackpoint but only a touchpad. The screen is matte with and anti-glare coating and has a resolution of 1366x768 pixels. A 720p webcam is mounted above the screen. It has media card reader, a USB 2.0 port, a USB 3.0 port, and HDMI 1.4 port and a headphone jack. Connectivity is provided by 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth] 4.0. The 11e fully supports the openSUSE flavor of the Linux operating system. ====S3 Yoga 14==== The Yoga 14 model reportedly "strikes the middle ground between bulky workstations and flexible hybrids." The laptop's metal hinge makes it sturdy, flexible and durable but has a below-average battery life. Like other models, the display can bend a full 360 degrees and the keyboard can be folded in half to use as a stand. According to a review for Business News Daily, "The ThinkPad Yoga 14 is a balancing act of diverse features. Thankfully, Lenovo pulled them all together into a satisfying work machine. The notebook features a high-quality build and an excellent keyboard and trackpad -- all must-have features for serious productivity. And extras like the TrackPoint pointing stick are great for legacy ThinkPad users who prefer those options." ==== S5 Yoga 15 ==== {| class="wikitable" style="font-size: 80%; text-align: center; min-width: 80%;" |- !

Lenovo claims the Yoga 260 has been subject to extensive testing of its ability to survive extreme temperatures, vibrations, altitudes, and shocks. Its keyboard is spill resistant. It includes a 12.5-inch display of resolution 1366x768 or 1920x1080.ThinkPad Yoga 260 User Guide An active stylus, the ThinkPad Pen Pro, is included for drawing and text entry; it can be used with Lenovo's WRITEit hand-writing recognition application.

The ThinkPad P40 Yoga, like other Yoga branded products, is a convertible device with "laptop, stand, tent, and tablet" modes. The P40 Yoga includes a touchscreen display with resolution of 1920x1080 or 2560x1440, designed in cooperation with Wacom, using that company's Active ES technology which can sense 2,048 different pressure levels.

The P40 uses Intel Core i7 CPUs, can accommodate up to 16 gigabytes of RAM, has SSDs up to 512 gigabytes in size, and uses an Nvidia Quadro M500M GPU. {| class="wikitable" style="font-size: 80%; text-align: center; min-width: 80%;" |- !

Brittany Hillen of Slashgear wrote, "The ThinkPad Yoga is a hybrid machine with a lot to offer users as both a laptop and as a tablet, though in slate mode it is thicker than what you'd get with a traditional tablet. There is nothing ill to speak of regarding the ThinkPad Yoga -- everything about it is solid, with the exception perhaps being a lower quality stylus than what an artist would need. The construction feels solid and durable in the hands, the keyboard is comfortable for typing in long duration stints, and the hardware is capable for a variety of tasks." James Kendrick of ZDNET wrote, "The ThinkPad Yoga is a great work laptop that can be pressed into tablet duty when desired. Its heavy-duty ThinkPad construction will stand up to the rigors of a road warrior. The battery life is reasonable and the beautiful screen works well in both laptop and tablet modes." The ThinkPad Yoga X1, (the first metal ThinkPad) has been given excellent reviews, with some review sites giving the new model a score of 4.5/5 stars. == See also == *Ideapad Yoga *ThinkPad X series *ThinkPad L series == References == Category:Lenovo laptops Category:Convertible laptops Category:2-in-1 PCs Yoga
