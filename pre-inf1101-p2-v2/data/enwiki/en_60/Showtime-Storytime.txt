Showtime, Storytime is a video release, released as a double Blu-ray, DVD and CD from Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish. Nuclear Blast recorded their live performance at Wacken Open Air in Wacken, Germany on August 3, 2013. Showtime, Storytime is the first Nightwish production to feature Floor Jansen on vocals. She initially replaced previous vocalist Anette Olzon during their North America tour leg, and on October 9, 2013, it was revealed that she would become an official band member, along with Troy Donockley. The running time of the concert is 1 hour and 38 minutes. The album also contains a 120-minute documentary about the first days of Jansen in the band, still as an only live member, and her process of adaptation in the band, called "Please Learn the Setlist in 48 Hours".http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/nightwish-ghost-love- score-performance-clip-from-showtime-storytime- dvd/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/nightwish-mainman-discusses-bands-new- lineup-in-second-showtime-storytime- trailer/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/nightwish-showtime-storytime-dvd-blu- ray-details- revealed/http://whiplash.net/materias/news_821/191863-nightwish.htmlhttp://metalmouth.net/2013/11/nightwish- reveal-new-trailer-for-showtime-storytime/ == Track listing == === Video disc 1=== ;Bonus track ===Video disc 2=== ==Members== *Floor Jansen - vocals *Tuomas Holopainen - keyboards *Emppu Vuorinen - guitars *Marco Hietala - bass guitar, clean male vocals (on tracks 2, 4, 5, 7, 11, 12, 14 & 15) *Jukka Nevalainen - drums *Troy Donockley - Uilleann pipes, flutes, additional vocals ==Charts performance== {| class="wikitable sortable" !DVDs Chart (2013) !Peak position |- |Belgian Music DVD Chart (Flanders) |align="center"|15 |- |Belgian Music DVD Chart (Wallonia) |align="center"|6 |- |Dutch Music DVD Chart |align="center"|14 |- |Finnish Music DVD Chart |align="center"|1 |- |French Music DVD Chart |align="center"|2 |- |German Music DVD Chart |align="center"|1 |- |align="left"|Japanese DVD Chart | style="text-align:center;"|131 |- |Swedish Music DVD Chart |align="center"|2 |- |} {| class="wikitable sortable" !Albums Chart (2013) !Peak position |- |Belgian Albums Chart (Flanders) |align="center"|184 |- |Belgian Albums Chart (Wallonia) |align="center"|158 |- |Finnish Albums Chart |align="center"|40 |- |align="left"|German Albums Chart | style="text- align:center;"|6 |- |align="left"|Korean Albums Chart | style="text- align:center;"|49 |- |align="left"|Swiss Albums Chart | style="text- align:center;"|52 |- |UK Albums Chart |align="center"|126 |- |UK Indie Albums Chart |align="center"|13 |- |UK Rock Albums Chart |align="center"|5 |- |US Hard Rock Albums Chart |align="center"|13 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Nightwish's Official Website Category:Nightwish video albums Category:Nightwish albums Category:2013 video albums Category:2013 live albums Category:Live video albums Category:Films shot in Germany
