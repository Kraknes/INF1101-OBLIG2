Visitors to East Timor must obtain a visa unless they come from one of the visa exempt countries. In accordance with the law, citizens of all countries except Indonesia, Cape Verde, and the Schengen Area must obtain a visa upon arrival or prior to arrival. In April 2019, the Interior Minister adopted an Order number 470 to be applied from 1 May 2019, requiring all non-visa-exempt visitors to obtain a visa from one of the East Timor diplomatic missions before arrival. However, this decision was subsequently suspended.Timor-Leste suspende novas regras para vistos de turismo e negocio ==Visa policy map== Visa policy of East Timor ==Visa exemption== *: Timor-Leste signed a mutual visa-waiver agreement with Cape Verde on 21 July 2014 and entered into force on 14 April 2015.
