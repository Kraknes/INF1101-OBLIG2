The Yangzhong Puffer Fish, or the "Puffer Fish Tower" is a notable 295-foot- long bronze statue in the shape of the puffer fish. Weighing 2,300 tons and reportedly costing $11 million, this statue sits on the banks of the Yangtze River in the Jiangsu Province of China. Work on this project was completed in 2013. The Yangzhong Puffer Fish sculpture is the largest steel-framework sculpture in China, and perhaps the entire world. ==References== Category:2013 establishments in China Category:2013 sculptures Category:Animal sculptures Category:Bronze sculptures in China Category:Chinese sculpture Category:Fish in art Category:Statues in China Category:Steel sculptures in China Category:Colossal statues in China
