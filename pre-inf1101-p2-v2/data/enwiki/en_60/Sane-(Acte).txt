Sane () was an ancient Greek city in the Acte headland (Mount Athos) of Chalcidice, situated upon the low, undulating ground, forming the isthmus which connects the peninsula of Acte with Chalcidice. It was founded by Andrians in the 7th century BCE. The ruins of the ancient city were found in the 21st century. Sane in Acte (or Athos) is mentioned by Herodotus in reference to the march of Xerxes I in Thrace, during the Second Persian invasion of Greece.Morgens Herman Hansen. Sane on Pallene.
