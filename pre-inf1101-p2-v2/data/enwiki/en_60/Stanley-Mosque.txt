The Stanley Mosque () is in Stanley, Hong Kong, China. It is the fourth mosque built in Hong Kong and it is located at the Stanley Prison. ==History== In the early 20th century, there were around 400 Muslim employees from Pakistan and India working for the Prison Department of Hong Kong. The headquarters office of the department was initially at Arbuthnot Road. Most of them went to Jamia Mosque to perform their prayer. However, following the relocation of the headquarters from Arbuthnot Road to Stanley Prison, which is much further away, there was a demand to set up a new mosque around the prison area to cater for the welfare and religious needs for the prison Muslim staffs. Thus, Stanley Mosque was opened inside the prison on 1 January 1937. The Advisory Board of Antiquities and Monuments Office designated the mosque as a Grade I historic building on 18 December 2009. Due to the safety reasons, the Correctionals Services staffs limted access to the mosque but you can show them your HK id card or tell them that "I came here for only praying". ==Architecture== The sandy coloured mosque has a large prayer hall, veranda and courtyard. A parking area is located in front of the mosque. The mosque is not generally open to the public as it is within the prison grounds. ==See also== * Islam in Hong Kong * List of mosques in Hong Kong ==References== Category:1937 establishments in Hong Kong Category:Indian diaspora in China Category:Mosques in Hong Kong Category:Pakistani diaspora in Asia Category:Mosques completed in 1937 Category:Grade I historic buildings in Hong Kong
