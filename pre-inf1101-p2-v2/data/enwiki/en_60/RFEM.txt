RFEM is a 3D finite element analysis software working under Microsoft Windows computer operating systems. RFEM can be used for structural analysis and design of steel, concrete, timber, glass, membrane and tensile structures as well as for plant and mechanical engineering or dynamic analysis. RFEM is used by more than 7,800 companies, 45,000 users and many universities in 95 countries. == BIM Integration == RFEM offers numerous interfaces for data exchange within the BIM process. All relevant building data is digitally maintained within a three-dimensional model, which then is used throughout all of the planning stages. As a result, the various CAD and structural analysis programs are using the same model, which is directly transferred between the programs. Besides direct interfaces to Autodesk AutoCAD, Autodesk Revit Structure, Autodesk Structural Detailing, Bentley Systems applications (ISM) and Tekla Structures, RFEM has interfaces for Industry Foundation Classes, CIS/2 and others. == Materials and cross-section libraries == RFEM's library of materials includes various types of concrete, metal, timber, glass, foil, gas and soil. RFEM's cross-section library includes rolled, built-up, thin- walled, and thick-walled cross-sections for steel, concrete, and timber. == References == Category:Building information modeling Category:Computer-aided design software Category:Finite element software Category:Computer-aided design software for Windows
