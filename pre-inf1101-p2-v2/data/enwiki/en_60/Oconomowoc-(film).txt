Oconomowoc is a 2013 American comedy film written by, directed by, and starring Andy Gillies. The film follows a man who, after moving back in with his hard-drinking mother, becomes part of a T-shirt business with his friend. ==Reception== The film has received universally negative critical reception, currently holding a 12/100 rating (indicating "universal dislike or disgust") on Metacritic and an 11% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The New York Times stated that the film "has one thing going for it: a running time of just 79 minutes, even if every one of them feels like an eternity." The Los Angeles Times called the film a "shaggy underachiever", while The Village Voice stated that "all conversation and action in the film take turns amounting to nothing." The film's sole semi-positive review came from Chuck Bowen of Slant Magazine, who posited that it "is extremely self-conscious, but in a fashion that generally serves the material" and is "an engagingly cynical ode to futility." ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:2013 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:2013 comedy films Category:American comedy films Category:American independent films Category:Films shot in Wisconsin Category:Films set in Wisconsin
