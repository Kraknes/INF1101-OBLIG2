Payback was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event and WWE Network event produced by WWE. It took place on June 1, 2014 at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Illinois. It was the second WWE pay-per-view held under the Payback name, the first having been held in 2013 at the same venue. Nine matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, were contested at the event. In the main event, The Shield (Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns) defeated Evolution (Triple H, Randy Orton, and Batista) in a No Holds Barred six-man tag team elimination match. In other prominent matches, John Cena defeated Bray Wyatt in a Last Man Standing match and Bad News Barrett defeated Rob Van Dam to retain the WWE Intercontinental Championship. It was the first WWE pay- per-view since Armageddon (2006) not to feature a World Championship match. Payback drew 67,000 buys (excluding WWE Network views), down from previous year's 186,000 buys. ==Production== ===Background=== In 2013, WWE established Payback and it replaced their previously running pay-per-view No Way Out. The 2014 event was subsequently the second event in the Payback chronology, thus establishing Payback as an annual event. ===Storylines=== The card consisted of nine matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by WWE's writers. Storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Raw and SmackDown. The main feud heading into the event was between Evolution (Triple H, Randy Orton and Batista) and The Shield (Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns). After losing to them at Extreme Rules, Evolution continued to feud with The Shield. The following night on Raw, Triple H forced Ambrose to defend his United States Championship in a 20-man battle royal, which was won by Sheamus. The Shield then fought The Wyatt Family later in the night; just as things turned in The Shield's favor, Evolution came out and distracted The Shield, allowing Bray Wyatt to pick up the win for the Wyatt Family by pinning Reigns. Evolution then assaulted The Shield and hit Reigns with The Shield's signature triple power bomb. The following week, The Shield challenged Evolution to a rematch at Payback, which Evolution accepted. It was announced following week on Raw that the match at Payback will be a No Holds Barred six-man elimination tag team match. Since costing him title matches at the Royal Rumble and Elimination Chamber, The Wyatt Family have been feuding with John Cena. This led to several matches at subsequent events, with Cena defeating Bray Wyatt at WrestleMania XXX in a singles match and Wyatt winning a steel cage match at Extreme Rules via escaping from the cage. On the May 12 episode of Raw, Wyatt challenged Cena to a Last Man Standing match, which was accepted by Cena on the May 16 episode of SmackDown. WWE World Heavyweight Champion Daniel Bryan announced on May 12 that he would have undergo neck surgery later that week. Because of this Stephanie McMahon suggested that Daniel Bryan would have to surrender the title if he cannot return to action by the pay-per-view where he was originally scheduled to defend against Kane. While his surgery was successful, it was still unknown if Bryan could compete for the title so McMahon gave him another week to surrender the title. On the May 26 episode of Raw, Bryan stated that while he found no shame in dropping the title due to injury, he did not want to give it to McMahon after everything he had been through. Upset at this, she gave Bryan one more chance to give her the title saying that if he does not surrender the title to her by the pay-per-view, she would fire his wife Brie Bella. El Torito and Hornswoggle would continue their feud. They previously fought at Extreme Rules in the first ever WeeLC match, which saw Torito defeat Hornswoggle. Hornswoggle put forth a Mask vs. Hair match wagering his hair against El Torito's mask which would take place on the Kickoff pre-show. Paige defended her WWE Divas Championship against Alicia Fox at Payback. The two divas faced each other on the May 12 episode of Raw, which Paige won, and on the May 19 episode of Raw, which Fox won. Sheamus defended his United States Championship against Cesaro at Payback. The two wrestlers fought to a double countout on the May 13 episode of Main Event. On the May 19 episode of Raw, Cesaro defeated Sheamus in a non-title rematch due to a distraction from Cesaro's manager Paul Heyman, setting up the title match at the pay-per-view. On the May 19 edition of Raw, there were three beat the clock challenge matches to determine a new number one contender to face Bad News Barrett for the WWE Intercontinental Championship at Payback. The matches were Big E vs. Ryback, Rob Van Dam vs. Alberto Del Rio, and Dolph Ziggler vs. Mark Henry. Big E beat Ryback to set a time of 5:02; Van Dam defeated Del Rio and set a new time of 4:15, and Ziggler and Henry wrestled to a time limit draw. This gave Van Dam the win and the title shot. On the May 26 episode of Raw, Zack Ryder celebrated Memorial Day by coming out with an American flag before facing Rusev. Rusev defeated Ryder via submission, but refused to let go after the bell rang until Big E came in, eventually knocking Rusev out of the ring. This set up a match between both men at Payback. ==Event== {|class=wikitable style="font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;" |+ Other on-screen personnel !|Role: !|Name: |- |rowspan=3|English Commentators |Michael Cole |- |John "Bradshaw" Layfield |- |Jerry Lawler |- |rowspan=3|Spanish Commentators |Carlos Cabrera |- |Marcelo Rodriguez |- |Ricardo Rodriguez |- |Backstage interviewer |Byron Saxton |- |rowspan=2|Ring announcers |Lilian Garcia |- |Justin Roberts |- |rowspan=5|Referees |Charles Robinson |- |John Cone |- |Darrick Moore |- |Ryan Tran |- |Chad Patton |- |rowspan=4|Pre-show panel |Josh Mathews |- |Booker T |- |Kofi Kingston |- |Alex Riley |} ===Pre-show=== During the Payback Kickoff pre-show, El Torito defeated Hornswoggle in a Mask vs. Hair match which was followed by El Torito shaving the head of Hornswoggle in a barber's chair at ringside. ===Preliminary matches=== The actual pay-per-view opened with Sheamus defending the United States Championship against Cesaro.

In the next match, John Cena faced Bray Wyatt in a Last Man Standing Match. Before the match, Tag Team Champions The Usos came out to support Cena and counteract Luke Harper and Erick Rowan of The Wyatt Family. During the match, both men executed their respective finishing moves - Wyatt a Sister Abigail and Cena an Attitude Adjustment - but in both cases, the opponent did not stay down.

Cena delivered an Attitude Adjustment to Wyatt but Harper and Rowan came back, attacked Cena and helped Wyatt stand. The Usos came back, attacking Harper and Rowan. Jey put Rowan through a table with a Running Hip Attack, which was followed by Harper putting Jimmy through two tables with a Superplex. Wyatt executed a Running Crossbody through the barricade on Cena but Cena managed to stand. In the end, Cena executed an Attitude Adjustment through an equipment crate on Wyatt and pushed another crate onto the crate which Wyatt was in. As Wyatt could not stand, Cena won the match.
