Chaves for 2009-10. He made his debut in the Segunda Liga on 16 August by featuring the full 90 minutes in a 0-1 home loss against C.D. Feirense, and contributed with a further 23 appearances as the season ended in relegation; additionally, he helped his team reach the final of the Taca de Portugal, being sent off in the last minute of a 1-2 defeat to FC Porto. In late January 2011, Rocha left Chaves and joined Primeira Liga club S.C. Beira-Mar on a free transfer. After failing to establish himself, he returned to the second level with S.C. Covilha in the summer. In another January transfer window move, and again as a free agent, Rocha returned to Chaves in 2013. He started in all his appearances in his first year, helping the side return to the second tier as champions. ==Honours== Chaves *Portuguese Second Division: 2012-13 *Taca de Portugal runner-up: 2009-10 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:People from Matosinhos Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:Portuguese Second Division players Category:AC Vila Mea players Category:G.D.
