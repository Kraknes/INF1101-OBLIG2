Sulfurovum lithotrophicum is a species of bacteria, the type species of its genus. It is a sulfur-oxidizing chemolithoautotroph within the e-Proteobacteria isolated from Okinawa Trough hydrothermal sediments. It is mesophilic and also oxidises thiosulfate. It is a Gram-negative, non-motile and coccoid to oval-shaped bacterium. The type strain is 42BKTT (=ATCC BAA-797T =JCM 12117T). ==References== ==Further reading== * *Voordeckers, James Walter.
