The base of the tagundaing at the Ye Le Pagoda in Kyauktan features Thagyamin. Tagundaing () refers to an ornamented victory column or flagstaff, typically , found within the grounds of Burmese Buddhist pagodas and kyaungs (monasteries). These ornamented columns were raised within religious compounds to celebrate the submission of nats (local animistic spirits) to the Dhamma, the Buddhist doctrine and inspired by the Pillars of Ashoka. A mythical hintha (or more rarely a kinnara) is generally found perching atop the column, while the base of the column may be decorated with Thagyamin. Vasudhara, the earth goddess, may also be found at the base. ==Examples== File:Inle Lake - Phaung Daw U Paya, Myanmar (169496788).jpg|Tagundaing at the Hpaung Daw U Pagoda modeled after the Pillars of Ashoka File:Inle Lake (16158076445).jpg File:Kyaik Pun Paya - Bago, Myanmar 20130219-13.jpg File:Mahamyatmuni Paya, Hsipaw, Myanmar (169498071).jpg File:Shwemawdaw Paya - Bago, Myanmar 20130219-20.jpg File:Shwemawdaw Paya - Bago, Myanmar 20130219-21.jpg ==See also== ** Ancient iron production ** Ashoka's Major Rock Edicts ** Dhar iron pillar ** Hindu temple architecture ** History of metallurgy in South Asia ** Iron pillar of Delhi ** List of Edicts of Ashoka ** Pillars of Ashoka ** Stambha ==References== ==See also== *Pillars of Ashoka *Lak Mueang Category:Burmese Buddhist architecture Category:Burmese Buddhist terminology Category:Monumental columns
