Shadows of Love is the seventh studio album by the American pop singer Nicolette Larson. It was released in 1988 in Italy only through CGD Records. The album was produced by Carlo Stretti and Ernesto Tabarelli. ==Background== With Shadows of Love, Larson returned to pop following her cross over into country music with the release of ...Say When (1985) and Rose of My Heart (1986). Shadows of Love was recorded in Italy during 1987 at Studio Watermelon in Milan. It was released as Larson's final mainstream album in 1988, and the album would also become her second to last studio album following her death in 1997, after the 1994 album Sleep, Baby, Sleep - a collection of children's lullabies. The album was not a commercial success and soon afterwards Larson began pursuing an acting career. The album features eight tracks with Larson co-writing two. The song "Love Hurts", originally released by The Everly Brothers in 1960, was written by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant. The title track "Shadows of Love" was originally performed by 1980s pop rock group Wax, and written by Andrew Gold and Graham Gouldman. American singer-songwriter Lauren Wood contributed two songs to the album, "Work on It" and "Where Did I Get These Tears". The latter track was originally found on Wood's self-titled 1979 debut album, while "Work on It" was included on her 1981 album Cat Trick. Larson had previously recorded another song of Wood's, "Fallen", for the album In the Nick of Time. The album's sole single was "Let Me Be the One" which was written by Larson and Mauro Paoluzzi. It was issued on both 7" and 12" vinyl by CGD in Europe. Co-produced by Paoluzzi, the single featured "Where Did I Get These Tears" as the B-side. The 7" vinyl single featured an edit of the "Let Me Be the One", cutting the song by approximately one minute, while the 12" vinyl version used the full-length album version. The single, like the album, was not a commercial success, and proved to be Larson's last single release. During 1988, Larson contributed to the soundtracks of the films Renegade and Twins. For Renegade, "Let Me Be the One" was used, and featured on the soundtrack release, which was issued by WEA in Germany that year. ==Release== Shadows of Love was issued on vinyl and cassette only in Italy, and to date has never been re-issued or fully released digitally on CD.http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item;=301020615892 Today, the out-of-print vinyl is scarce and fetches high prices. During the year of the album's release, CGD (Compagnia Generale del Disco) went out of business. Warner Music Group acquired the label to form CGD East West and continued CGD's operations. In 2013, Pro Music issued a promotional slipcase CD of the album, however in an extremely limited quantity.http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Nicolette-Larson-Rare-Cd-Shadows-Of- Love-/221292018073?_trksid=p2047675.l2557&ssPageName;=STRK%3AMEWAX%3AIT&nma;=true&si;=dP6zQLXIsNAJqjQmafobjaJkVTM%253D&orig;_cvip=true&rt;=nc ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Nicolette Larson - vocals * Andrea Braido - guitar * Mimmo Bianchi - keyboards, bass, drums * Riccardo Luppi - saxophone * Gwen Aanti, Daniela Rando, Betty Vittori, Massimo Crestini - backing vocals * Carlo Stretti, Ernesto Tabarelli - producers ==References== Category:1988 albums Category:Nicolette Larson albums Category:Compagnia Generale del Disco albums
