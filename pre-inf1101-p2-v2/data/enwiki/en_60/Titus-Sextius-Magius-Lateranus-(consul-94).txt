Titus Sextius Magius Lateranus was a Roman Senator who lived during the second half of the 1st century and first half of the 2nd century. Lateranus served as a consul ordinarius in 94 as the colleague of Lucius Nonius Calpurnius Torquatus Asprenas.Paul Gallivan, "The Fasti for A. D. 70-96", Classical Quarterly, 31 (1981), pp. 191, 218 He is known entirely from inscriptions. In his monograph on Roman naming practices, Olli Salomies points out that the short form of his name was Titus Sextius Lateranus, showing he was a member of the gens Sextia. Based on the inscription his relatives included Titus Sextius Africanus, suffect consul in 59. The third element in his name, "Magia", may indicate his mother came from the Magii, a praetorian family.Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire, (Helsinski: Societas Scientiarum Fenica, 1992), p. 106 Lateranus married the Roman noblewoman Volussia Torquata, one of the children of Quintus Volusius Saturninus and his wife Nonia Torquata.Biographischer Index der Antike, p. 864 Their children included Titus Sextius Cornelius Africanus, who served as a consul in 112.Bennett, Trajan: Optimus Princeps: a Life and Times, p. 183 ==References== ==Sources== *J.
