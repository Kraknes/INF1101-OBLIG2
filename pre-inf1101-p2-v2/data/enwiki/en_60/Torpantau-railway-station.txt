Torpantau railway station was a station in the Welsh county of Brecknockshire (now in Powys). It was served by trains on the line from Merthyr to Brecon. It was the highest station on the Brecon and Merthyr Railway. Torpantau is a remote location, though a few passengers may have worked on the local dams, or fished there for leisure. The location was most significant in operational terms for watering engines and tying down brakes before a descent. It is near the (now) Northern Terminus of the narrow gauge Brecon Mountain Railway. ==History== Opened by the Brecon and Merthyr Tydfil Railway. In 1916 a train passed a signal at danger near the station causing a collision that killed two people.Accident at Torpantau on 3 February 1916 It became part of the Great Western Railway during the grouping of 1923. Torpantau closed to passengers in December 1962 but the line was retained for freight workings to Brecon until 4 May 1964. == Torpantau Tunnel == To the north of the station lies Torpantau Tunnel, (aka Beacons Tunnel) through the Beacons pass. Torpantau Tunnel is 666 yards (609m) long, and the south-west portal, (railway mileage 14miles-2 3/4 chains from Brecon station), was reached after a three-mile (5 km) ascent from the Merthyr side. Exiting from the tunnel (13 miles-52 1/4 chains from Brecon station) to the south-east, the line descended for 6 3/4 miles along the side of Glyn Collwyn (now flooded to form a reservoir) and on to the former Talybont- on-Usk station and River Usk at Talybont. Thence it climbed to Pennorth and Talyllyn junction and on to Brecon. At an elevation of , it was the highest standard gauge tunnel above sea level, in regular use by BR anywhere in Great Britain. Though access is discouraged, the tunnel remains accessible on foot. Tunnel description The Eastern portal of the tunnel is a Grade II listed building. == The station site today == The site is a popular start point for walks in the Brecon Beacons. It lies on the National Cycle Network NCR 8 (Taff Trail). As from December 2000, the narrow gauge Brecon Mountain Railway had extended its 2 ft-gauge line to a new terminus just-south of the historic station site and the southern entrance of Torpantau tunnel but due to motive power constraints because of the steeply graded trackbed, the extended passenger service from Dolygaer run-around loop to Torpantau terminus, a distance of 1mile-35chains, only became operational on 1 April 2014. == References == ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Photographs *Signalbox track diagram Category:Disused railway stations in Powys Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1863 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1962
