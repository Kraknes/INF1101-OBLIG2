Minister of Culture opens The Nordic Media Festival 2013 The Nordic Media Festival is the largest media conference in the Nordic region. Held annually in Bergen, Norway, the Festival features 100 speakers, and around 1,860 delegates attend, representing the full spectrum of the industry. Founded in 1988, the festival is a non-profit foundation. In addition to the conference and unique networking events, a variety of projects are organized for high- school students: NMD Ung gives youth an opportunity to increase their competence and gain access to the media industry.
