In March 2009, Color Force, an independent studio founded by producer Nina Jacobson, bought the film rights to the book. She then sought out production company Lionsgate to help her produce the film. Collins was also attached to adapt the novel; she began the first draft after completing the third novel in the series, Mockingjay (2010). The search for a director began in 2010 with three directors in the running; David Slade, Sam Mendes, and Gary Ross. Ross was ultimately chosen to direct. By the time Collins had finished the script, Ross decided to go through the script with Collins and screenwriter Billy Ray. In October 2010, scripts were sent to the actors, and casting occurred between March and May 2011. The first role cast was of the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen. As many as 30 actresses were in talks to play the part, with Jennifer Lawrence, Hailee Steinfeld, Abigail Breslin, and Chloe Grace Moretz being mentioned most. The role was given to Lawrence. The roles of Peeta Mellark, Katniss' fellow tribute, and Gale Hawthorne, her best friend, began casting later that month. Top contenders for Peeta included Josh Hutcherson, Alexander Ludwig (later cast as Cato), Hunter Parrish, Evan Peters, and Lucas Till. Contenders for Gale included Robbie Amell, Liam Hemsworth, David Henrie, and Drew Roy. On April 4, it was reported that Hemsworth had been cast as Gale, and Hutcherson had been cast as Peeta. ==Films== {| class="wikitable plainrowheaders" style="text-align:center" width=100% |- ! scope="col" style="width:22%;"| Film ! scope="col" | U.S. release date ! scope="col" | Director ! scope="col" | Screenwriter(s) ! scope="col" | Story by ! scope="col" | Producers |- ! scope="row" style="text- align:left" | The Hunger Games | style="text-align:center" | | Gary Ross | colspan="2"|Gary Ross and Suzanne Collins and Billy Ray | rowspan="4"| Nina Jacobson and Jon Kilik |- ! scope="row" style="text-align:left" | The Hunger Games: Catching Fire | style="text-align:center" | | rowspan="4"| Francis Lawrence | colspan="2"| Simon Beaufoy and Michael deBruyn |- ! scope="row" style="text-align:left" | The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 | style="text- align:center" | | colspan="2" rowspan="2"| Peter Craig and Danny Strong |- ! scope="row" style="text-align:left" | The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 | style="text-align:center" | |- ! scope="row" style="text-align:left" | The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes | | Michael Arndt | Suzanne Collins | Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson |} ===The Hunger Games (2012)=== Every year, in the ruins of what was once North America, the Capitol of the nation of Panem forces each of the 12 districts to send a boy and girl tribute between the ages of 12 and 18 to compete in the Hunger Games: a nationally televised event in which the 'tributes' fight each other to the death until one survivor remains. When Primrose Everdeen is "reaped," her older sister Katniss Everdeen volunteers in her place as tribute to enter the games and is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts and knowledge when she's pitted against highly- trained and fierce tributes from all of the other districts and has to think quickly on her feet to survive. ===The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013)=== Along with fellow District 12 victor Peeta Mellark, Katniss Everdeen returns home safely after winning the 74th Annual Hunger Games. Winning means that they must leave their loved ones behind and embark on a Victory Tour throughout the districts for a couple of days. Along the way Katniss senses a rebellion simmering upon the capitol - one that she and Peeta may have sparked - but the Capitol is still in control as President Snow prepares the 75th Hunger Games - the Third Quarter Quell - that could change Panem forever. Past victors will be reaped in the 75th Hunger Games the Third Quarter Quell. ===The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 (2014)=== Following her rescue from the devastating Quarter Quell, Katniss Everdeen awakes in the complex beneath the supposedly destroyed District 13. Her home, District 12, has been reduced to rubble by the Capitol. Peeta Mellark was kidnapped by the Capitol and is now brainwashed and being held captive by President Snow. Snow wants Peeta to forget everything he had loved about Katniss. At the same time, Katniss also learns about a secret rebellion spreading throughout all of Panem - a rebellion that will place her at the center of attention and she will have to turn the tables on President Snow. ===The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)=== Realizing the stakes are no longer just for survival, Katniss Everdeen teams up with her closest friends, including Peeta Mallark, Gale Hawthorne and Finnick Odair for the ultimate mission to gain peace. Together, they leave District 13 to liberate the citizens of war that has torn Panem apart more than it has ever been. President Snow becomes obsessed with destroying Katniss Everdeen and everyone and everything she loves. What lies ahead are mortal traps, dangerous enemies and moral choices that will ultimately determine the future of millions of people. ===The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (TBA)=== In August of 2017, Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer expressed interest in spin-offs of The Hunger Games, with intentions to create a writers room to explore the concept.
