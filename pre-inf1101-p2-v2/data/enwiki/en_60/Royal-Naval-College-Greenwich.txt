The Royal Naval College, Greenwich, was a Royal Navy training establishment between 1873 and 1998, providing courses for naval officers. It was the home of the Royal Navy's staff college, which provided advanced training for officers. The equivalent in the British Army was the Staff College, Camberley and the equivalent in the Royal Air Force was the RAF Staff College, Bracknell. ==History== The Royal Naval College, Greenwich, was founded by an Order in Council dated 16 January 1873. The establishment of its officers consisted of a President, who was always a Flag Officer; a Captain, Royal Navy; a Director of Studies; and Professors of Mathematics, Physical Science, Chemistry, Applied Mechanics, and Fortification. It was to take in officers who were already Sub-Lieutenants and to operate as "the university of the Navy".J. R. Hill, Bryan Ranft, The Oxford Illustrated History of the Royal Navy (2002), p. 269 The Director of Studies, a civilian, was in charge of an Academic Board, while the Captain of the College was a naval officer who acted as chief of staff.Geoffrey Till, Bryan Ranft, The Development of British Naval Thinking (2006) The Royal Naval War College, which had been established at Portsmouth in November 1900, transferred its activities to the college at Greenwich in 1914.Hazell's Annual 1914, p. 143 During the First World War the Royal Naval College was requisitioned as a barracks and for scientific experiments. The training of officers was not resumed until 1919.Kevin Littlewood, Beverley Butler, Of Ships and Stars: Maritime Heritage and the Founding of the National Maritime Museum (1998), p. 43 On 30 October 1939 the college began to train officers of the Women's Royal Naval Service.Marjorie H. Fletcher, The WRNS: A History of the Women's Royal Naval Service (1989), p. 115 During the Second World War, the College increased the number of officers of both sexes trained for an expanded Navy. Its major task was the training of fighting officers, and around 35,000 men and women graduated during that period. In 1943, the beautiful Admiral's House on the north wing of King Charles Court was damaged by a direct hit from a German bomb; another bomb hit the front of the building.The Greenwich Foundation for the Old Royal Naval College The Navy's Department of Nuclear Science and Technology opened on the college premises in 1959, and JASON, the department's research and training reactor, was commissioned in the King William building in 1962.Jason casts a cloud over naval college sale in The Independent dated 22 October 1995 In 1967 Queen Elizabeth II knighted Francis Chichester on the river steps of the College, honouring his achievement in circumnavigating the world as a solo yachtsman, using the old route of the clippers, becoming the first to do so. His was also the fastest such circumnavigation, taking nine months and one day.1967: Sir Francis Chichester sails home at BBC.co.uk The Royal School of Naval Architecture, which had been part of the College since 1873, transferred to University College London in 1967.J.

This closed in 1869, when the pensioners were transferred to other places, leaving the buildings available for a new use.Ann Stewart Balakier, James J. Balakier, The Spatial Infinite at Greenwich in Works by Christopher Wren (1995), p. i The site of the former hospital had once been occupied by the medieval Palace of Placentia, or "Palace at Greenwich", begun by Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, in 1428.Guy McDonald, England (2004), p. 125 After the Royal Navy departed in 1998 the buildings were opened to the public as the Old Royal Naval College. ==Presidents== :See also :Category:Admiral presidents of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich The President of the College was a full- time post until 1982 when it became an honorary role held by the Second Sea Lord (and from 1994 an honorary role held by the Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff).Royal Navy Senior Appointments at gulabin.com, accessed 9 October 2013 Presidents included: *Vice-Admiral Sir Astley Cooper Key (1873-1875) *Admiral Sir Edward Gennys Fanshawe (1875-1878) *Admiral Sir Charles Frederick Alexander Shadwell (1878-1881) *Admiral Sir Geoffrey Phipps Hornby (1881-1882) *Admiral William Garnham Luard (1882-1885) *Vice-Admiral Sir Thomas Brandreth (1885-1888) *Admiral Sir William Graham (1888-1891) *Admiral Sir Richard Vesey Hamilton (1891-1894) *Admiral Sir Walter James Hunt-Grubbe (1894-1897) *Admiral Sir Richard Tracey (1897-1900) *Admiral Sir Robert More-Molyneux (1900-1903) *Admiral Sir Robert Hastings Penruddock Harris (1903-1906) *Admiral Sir Arthur Dalrymple Fanshawe (1906-1908) *Admiral Sir John Durnford (1908-1911) *Admiral Sir Frederic William Fisher (1911-1914) *Vice-Admiral The Hon.
