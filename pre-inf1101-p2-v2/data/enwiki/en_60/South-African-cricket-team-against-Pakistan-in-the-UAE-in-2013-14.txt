Jacques Kallis was also playing his first Test since last February. Hashim Amla's partnerships of 61 runs for the fourth wicket with AB de Villiers (19), and 95 runs for the fifth with Jean-Paul Duminy (57) stopped the Pakistani bowlers who have ruined their top-order, with 43 for three. Zulfiqar Babar and Shan Masood -- on his twenty-fourth birthday -- made their Test debuts for Pakistan. Zulfiqar, a left arm spinner, was most successful taking three wickets for 89. Amla reached his twentieth century in 201 balls, and at the end of the day, he was unbeaten on 118, with South Africa on 245 for eight wickets. ;Day 2 South Africa were restricted to 249 runs in 93.1 overs, and Mohammad Irfan finished with three wickets for 44 runs in 18.2 overs. Younus Khan equaled Javed Miandad's record for Pakistan taking his ninety-third catch in Test cricket; he caught Amla off the bowling of Irfan. Pakistan started their innings with a new opening pair -- Khurram Manzoor and Masood -- who put on a century partnership of 135 runs. This was the first century-stand from Pakistani openers since January. Masood started his innings with a boundary off Dale Steyn, and scored 75 runs on his debut, before given leg before wicket off Duminy's bowling. At the end of the second day, Manzoor was unbeaten on 131 runs, and Pakistan were 263 runs for three wickets. ;Day 3 Manzoor scored 146 runs before falling to Philander; he surpassed Azhar Mahmood's 136 runs and became the highest run-scorer in a Test innings by a Pakistani batsman against South Africa. Misbah-ul-Haq scored 100 runs, his first century since May 2011, and fourth overall in Test cricket. Asad Shafiq added 54 runs, and Pakistan led by 193 in the first innings, scoring 442 runs. Philander took three wickets while conceding 84 runs in 26 overs. At the end of the day, South Africa were 72 for four wickets in 26 overs, with De Villiers on 10 and Steyn on zero. ;Day 4 Nightwatchman, Steyn, was dismissed by Babar on seven. De Villiers, who scored his thirty-third half century in Test cricket, was South African second innings' top scorer, with 90 runs. His partnership of 57 runs with Robin Peterson prevented South Africa from an innings defeat; the latter scored 47 runs not out. South Africa took their total to 232 runs in 82.4 overs, this left Pakistan a target of only 40 runs. Saeed Ajmal took four wickets for 74 runs. Pakistan lost their first three wickets for seven runs while chasing the target. They achieved the target in the fourteenth over, with a six hit by Misbah over Peterson. This was Pakistan's fourth consecutive win against a world's no.1 Test team in the UAE; they remained unbeaten for the ninth consecutive time there. South Africa lost for the first time a Test since 2011, after 15 consecutive unbeaten matches. Adnan Akmal and Peterson were fined 50% of their match fee by the International Cricket Council (ICC), due to violation of "Article 2.2.4 of the ICC Code of Conduct for players and player support personnel". ===2nd Test=== ==ODI series== ===1st ODI=== ===2nd ODI=== ===3rd ODI=== ===4th ODI=== ===5th ODI=== ==T20I series== ===1st T20I=== ===2nd T20I=== ==References== ==Broadcasting rights== {| class="wikitable" |- !
