Timothy Ian Britten is a senior sergeant in the Western Australia Police. He is one of the five recipients of the Cross of Valour, Australia's highest civilian bravery decoration. He was awarded the Cross of Valour for his actions in the immediate aftermath of the 2002 Bali bombings. This award makes him Australia's highest-decorated police officer. ==2002 Bali bombings== On 12 October 2002, Britten was in Bali on leave. As a Western Australia Police constable, he was serving with the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor. While walking back to his hotel at approximately 11:00 pm, he heard an explosion that he believed had resulted from a bomb. Britten immediately responded, running approximately 800 metres to the Sari Club. Upon arriving at the Sari Club, Britten found that the club had been destroyed, having been reduced to a burning shell. The victims of the bombing were lying all about the scene. It was reported to Britten that there was a woman trapped in the building. Without hesitation, he ran into the burning building, making his way through the debris as gas cylinders exploded around him. He located the severely injured woman, who was conscious but pinned underneath rubble and a piece of iron. Forced back by the intense heat and smoke from the fire, Britten left the burning remains of the building to seek help. Finding fellow Australian Richard Joyes out in the street searching for his own friends, Britten recruited Joyes to enter the building with him to attempt to rescue the trapped woman. Again, forced back by the heat of the fire, Britten and Joyes had to leave the building. Lacking any type of protective clothing, Britten and Joyes were doused in bottled water in an attempt to protect themselves from the fire, as they again re-entered the building. On this third attempt for Britten, he and Joyes were able to free the woman from the wreckage, carrying her out of the club, where she was transported to receive medical attention. After freeing the woman, Britten continued to search the building for survivors until the intensity of the fire made it impossible to continue. Throughout his rescue attempts, Britten was aware of the danger of being severely injured or killed, yet persisted in his efforts until it was no longer possible. In summary, the citation for the Cross of Valour states: "Constable Britten remained at the site helping Indonesian police and security guards, and only when he felt assured that emergency workers had the Sari Club site secured did he return to his hotel. On that night, Constable Britten selflessly placed himself in constant danger, sustaining burns to his arm, deep cuts and abrasions to his feet from explosion debris, potential injury from gas cylinder explosions, and exposure to deadly infection from blood- borne diseases." In 2016, Melbourne-based artist George Petrou painted Britten's portrait as his entry for Archibald Prize. The portrait was a black- and-white painting of Britten in his police uniform, wearing his medals. All of the medals, except the Cross of Valour, are painted in black and white. The Cross of Valour was painted in its actual colours of red and gold. ==Cross of Valour== The Tim Britten exhibit at the Maryborough Military and Colonial Museum.
