Topografov virus is an enveloped, negative-sense RNA virus species of the genus orthohantavirus in the Bunyavirales order. It is the first hantavirus to be isolated from Siberian lemmings (Lemmus sibiricus) found near the Topografov River in the Taymyr Peninsula, Siberia.Plyusnin A, Vapalahti O, Lundkvist A, Henttonen H, Vaheri A. Newly recognized hantavirus in Siberian lemmings. Lancet. 1996;347:1835-1836.Olli Vapalahti., Ake Lundkvist, Vadim Fedorov, et al. Isolation and Characterization of a Hantavirus from Lemmus sibiricus: Evidence for Host Switch during Hantavirus Evolution. J Virol. 1999 July; 73(7): 5586-5592 == Virology == Hantaviruses have been shown to evolve with their hosts. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that Topografov virus is related to Khabarovsk virus and Puumala virus. This close relationship is believed to be due to a rodent host switch that took place at some point their respective evolutions. Plyusnin A, Vapalahti O, Vaheri A. Hantaviruses: genome structure, expression and evolution. J Gen Virol. 1996;77:2677-2687. Topografov virus and Khabarovsk virus are believed to have a common ancestor, possibly from a Microtus species that lived over 1 million years ago.Modi W S.

Guidelines to the demarcation of virus species. Arch Virol. 1997;142:1505-1528. This host switch has been known to occur only once before in white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in North America.Morzunov S P, Rowe J E, Ksiazek T G, Peters C J, St. Jeor S C, Nichol S T.
