The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) is a registered Scottish charity which represents the independent school sector in Scotland. Its membership includes mainstream fee-paying independent schools and a range of schools for young people with complex additional support needs. ==Background== Independent Schools in Scotland are inspected by the national school inspectorate, Education Scotland; pastoral services including nursery and boarding are regulated by the Care Inspectorate. The majority of Scottish independent schools are registered charities, as their purpose is the advancement of education. As such, their charitable activities are overseen by the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator which is responsible for confirming independent schools' public benefit by means of a charity test required by the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005. SCIS was founded in 1978 and became a company and charity in 1990. SCIS represents over 70 member schools in Scotland.
