The Picual, also known as Martena or Loperena, is an olive cultivar from Spain. Picual olives are the most commonly grown olive today for olive oil production, with production centered in the Spanish province of Jaen. Picual trees are estimated to account for 25% of all olive oil production in the world. Naturally, this varietal is very high in oil content, at 20-27% by weight. ==Characteristics== Virgin olive oil from Picual olives have high levels of polyphenols (an organic compound which is known to have antioxidant effects), typically between 300 and 700ppm. Many Picual groves are primarily harvested when ripe or overripe to maximize oil content, and thus produce oil with poor taste qualities. Less than one quarter of the harvest each year qualifies as Extra Virgin. ==Synonyms== Aceite (de), Albaideno, Andaluza, Blanca, Calidad (de), Carlon, Corriente, Doncel, Fina, Grosal, Jabata, Javata, Lopereno, Marteno, Marteno Basto, Fino, Molejona, Moradillo, Moradillo Negro, Moradillo Temprano, Morcona, Morenillo, Nevadillo, Nevadillo Blanco, Nevadillo de Martos, Nevado, Nevado Blanco, Nevado Blanco Productivo, Olive Grosse de Tlemcen, Olivo Macho de Santisteban del Puerto, Picua', Picual de Hoja Clara, Picual de Hoja Oscura, Picual de Jaen, Picuda, Picual de Almeria, Picudo, Picudo de Martos, Picudo Loporeno, Picudo Marteno, Picvalles, Redondilla, Salgar, Salgares, Sevillano, Sir George Grey's Spanish, Temprana, Tetudilla, Picual de Almeria, Picual de Almeria (Gordal), Picual de Almeria (Picual), Picual de Estepa, Picual de Estepa (Picual), and Picudo (Picual)\- Retrieved 2018-07-09\- Retrieved 2018-07-09 == References == Category:Olive cultivars
