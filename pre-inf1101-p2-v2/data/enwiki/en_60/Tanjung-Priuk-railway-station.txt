Tanjung Priuk Station (TPK), is a railway station in Tanjung Priok, Tanjung Priok, North Jakarta. It is located across the Tanjung Priok Port, which is the main port of Jakarta. This station is one of the oldest in Jakarta and the biggest station built during the Dutch East Indies era. It is included in the list of heritage building by the government of Jakarta. == History== The history of Tanjung Priuk station is intertwined with the port of Tanjung Priok, the main port and gateway to Batavia and thereby of the entire Dutch East Indies. The port was built in 1877 in response to the increased maritime traffic accompanying the opening of the Suez Canal. Since Tanjung Priok is situated further away from Batavia than the old port of Sunda Kelapa, a railway was constructed linking Tanjung Priok to the city of Batavia in the southwest. This would provide a safe and comfortable means of transportation in the swampy area. The first station opened in 1885 on the quay immediately next to the first harbour. The second and current station was built a kilometer southward in 1914. The Art Deco building was designed by C.W. Koch, head engineer of the Staatsspoorwegen (SS). 1700 workers, including 130 Europeans, were tasked with constructing the station and the station was completed on 6 April 1925. The station ceased to operate passenger trains between 2000 and 2009, during which the station was used for shunting freight trains. The station was renovated and reopened for passenger services on 28 April 2009. == Services == So far only a few long distance economy class trains depart/terminate at this station. Starting from 1 November 2014, Tanjung Priuk Station only serves freight trains heading from/to Tanjung Priok Port. All passenger trains that used to terminate here were rerouted to Pasar Senen. On 21 December 2015, the pink line to Jakarta Kota railway station was reopened, after being inactive for years. == Public transport == * TransJakarta Corridor 10 * TransJakarta Corridor 12 == References == ==External links== * Category:North Jakarta Category:Railway stations in Jakarta Category:Railway stations opened in 1885 Category:Colonial architecture in Jakarta Category:Art Deco railway stations
