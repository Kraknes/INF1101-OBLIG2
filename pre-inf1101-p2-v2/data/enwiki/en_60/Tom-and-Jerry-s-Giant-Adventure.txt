Tom and Jerry's Giant Adventure is a 2013 animated fantasy comedy direct-to- video film starring Tom and Jerry, produced by Warner Bros. Animation. Tom and Jerry are the faithful servants of Jack, son of the founder of a struggling storybook amusement park that gets a much-needed boost thanks to some mysterious magical beans. == Plot == Tom and Jerry live with Jack and his mother in Storybook Town, a fairy tale-inspired theme park. The park has been ailing since the death of its founder, Jack's father. Young Jack is desperate to save the park from the hands of a greedy billionaire who bought the park's mortgage, setting out with his loyal cat and mouse friends to sell his performing cow to make the next mortgage payment. Too late to sell it to a nearby circus, they trade the cow to a mysterious farmer for a handful of magic beans. What follows is a journey up a beanstalk to Fairyland, a magical land ruled by a greedy giant and home to all manner of fabled characters, some portrayed by classic MGM cartoon characters such as Droopy as Old King Cole and Screwy Squirrel as Simple Simon's pieman. Now, Tom and Jerry must put an end to their furry feud long enough to save both Fairyland and Storybook Town. == Cast == * Spike Brandt (uncredited) as Tom Cat and Tyke * Dee Bradley Baker (uncredited) as Jerry Mouse * Jacob Bertrand as Jack Bradley * Garrison Keillor as the Narrator and Farmer O'Dell * Tom Wilson as Mr. Bigley and Ginormous * Kath Soucie as Tuffy * Joe Alaskey as Droopy * Paul Reubens as Screwy Squirrel * Grey DeLisle as Mrs. Bradley and Red Fairy * Richard McGonagle as Barney Bear * Phil LaMarr as Spike * John DiMaggio as Meathead Dog == Reception == Chaz Lipp states the movie is "is a harmless hour of fun that should ably hold the attention of its target audiences," but confused about the lack of "fighting, chasing and general struggle between the title characters." == Follow-up film == Tom and Jerry: The Lost Dragon was released on September 2, 2014. == References == == External links == * Category:2013 films Category:2013 animated films Category:2013 direct-to-video films Category:2010s American animated films Category:Animated comedy films Category:American adventure comedy films Category:American children's animated adventure films Category:American children's animated comedy films Category:American fantasy adventure films Category:American films Category:Animated films based on children's books Category:2010s children's fantasy films Category:Animated crossover films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on Jack and the Beanstalk Category:Films directed by Spike Brandt Category:Films directed by Tony Cervone Category:Films scored by Michael Tavera Category:Films with screenplays by Paul Dini Category:Tom and Jerry films Category:Warner Bros.
