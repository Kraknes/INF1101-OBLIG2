Swing Into Sports was an early American television series which ran Sundays at 8pm ET from 1947 to circa mid-1949. ==Production background== The series aired on New York City television station WABD, which at the time was the flagship station for the DuMont Television Network. The series is notable not just as an early example of sports-themed television programming, but for having a surviving episode from 1948 (see below). The series featured Joan Arliss (per Paley Center for Media) or Joan Kerwin (per Billboard magazine) and Chuck Tranum. Tranum is also known for having hosted Manhattan Spotlight.IMDB entry Billboard magazine (see below) listed the sponsor as Transmirra Image Definer (misprinted as Transmirra Imgea Refiner), and the producer as being Bob Loewi. ==Reception== The 22 November 1947 edition of Billboard gave the series a mixed review. A writer for the magazine said "As a low-budget live production, the concept behind the show is a fresh one which should provide interesting and relaxing diversion for home viewers - the kind of program badly needed by video. Execution, however, falls somewhat short of concept, altho it has improved considerably in recent weeks". ==Episode status== A single episode of this series is held by the Paley Center for Media, listed as having aired August 29, 1948.Paley Center for Media entry ==See also== *List of programs broadcast by the DuMont Television Network *List of surviving DuMont Television Network broadcasts ==References== ==Bibliography== *David Weinstein, The Forgotten Network: DuMont and the Birth of American Television (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2004) *Alex McNeil, Total Television, Fourth edition (New York: Penguin Books, 1980) *Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh, The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network TV Shows, Third edition (New York: Ballantine Books, 1964) Category:1947 American television series debuts Category:1949 American television series endings Category:Black-and-white American television shows Category:English-language television shows Category:American live television series Category:DuMont Television Network original programming Category:Sports television in the United States Category:1940s American television series Category:Local television programming in the United States
