Yamaguchi 1st district (Shan Kou [Xian Di ]1Qu , Yamaguchi[-ken dai-]ikku) is a single-member electoral district for the House of Representatives, the lower house of the National Diet of Japan. It is located in Yamaguchi and covers the prefectural capital Yamaguchi (without the former town of Ato), parts of the city of Shunan (the area of former municipalities Tokuyama city, Shinnan'yo city, Kano town) and the city of Hofu. As of September 2012, 359,151 eligible voters were resident in the district.MIC: Ping Cheng 24Nian 9Yue 2Ri Xian Zai Xuan Ju Ren Ming Bo Ji biZai Wai Xuan Ju Ren Ming Bo Deng Lu Zhe Shu >Xuan Ju Qu gotonoXuan Ju Ren Ming Bo Ji biZai Wai Xuan Ju Ren Ming Bo Deng Lu Zhe Shu Deng  Before the electoral reform of the 1990s, the area had been part of the five-member Yamaguchi 2nd district which covered roughly the Eastern half of the prefecture and had been the former district of LDP presidents Nobusuke Kishi and Eisaku Sato. Another representative from the pre-reform 2nd district for the LDP was former four- term Tokuyama city mayor Sakahiko Komura. When Komura retired, his fourth son Masahiko won a seat in the district in 1980 and defended it in all pre-reform elections. After the electoral reform, Masahiko Komura took over the new single-member 1st district for the LDP. The main opposition NFP and the newly founded DPJ did not even nominate candidates in the first post-reform election of 1996, his only challengers were a Communist and an unaffiliated independent. In subsequent elections, the enlarged/"New" DPJ did nominate candidates; but Komura held onto the seat by large margins, even in the countrywide DPJ victory of 2009. The district remains - like two other of Yamaguchi's districts - an unbroken "conservative kingdom" (hoshu okoku). In the 2017 election Masahiko Komura retired, his eldest son Masahiro extended the streak with a two-thirds majority in his first election. Komura was a minister in several cabinets in the 1990s and 2000s (Murayama, Obuchi, Mori II, Fukuda, Abe I). From 2000 to 2012, Komura led the Bancho Seisaku Kenkyujo (previously Komoto faction, now Oshima faction), one of the smaller, but well- established factions of the LDP that traces its roots to the centrist Reform Party and the pre-war Constitutional Democratic Party. In 2012, LDP president Shinzo Abe (Machimura faction, also from Yamaguchi) nominated him to succeed fellow faction member Tadamori Oshima as vice president of the party. ==List of representatives== {| class=wikitable |- valign=bottom !
