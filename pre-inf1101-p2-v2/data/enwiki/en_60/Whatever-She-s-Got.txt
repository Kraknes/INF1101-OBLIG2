Dukes called the song "pop-friendly and not nearly as deep" compared to Nail's previous singles and wrote that "banjo and electric guitar noodling keep flashbacks of 'N Sync out of one's head, but are few lyrics that deliver a punch to remember." Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave the song four stars out of five, saying that "the production is contemporary as the melody and lyric warrant but for as country/pop [as] 'Whatever She's Got' feels, it isn't so 'pop' as to think it wouldn't play well within country radio." Bjorke also stated that "the lyrics, the melody and David Nail's vocal all work together to make the song a memorable song." ==Chart and sales performance== "Whatever She's Got" debuted at number 51 on the U.S. Billboard Country Airplay chart for the week of June 15, 2013.
