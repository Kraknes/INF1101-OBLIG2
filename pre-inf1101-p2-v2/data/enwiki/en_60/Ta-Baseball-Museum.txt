The Tampa Baseball Museum is proposed to open in Ybor City, Florida. The Tampa Baseball Museum will be located in Al Lopez's historic childhood home in Ybor City. The museum collection is transitioning from a special exhibit, Beisbol: Tampa's Love of the Game, at the Ybor City Museum State Park. Tampa has a 125-year history with baseball that includes many professional, semi- professional, and amateur leagues and players, as well as Inter-Social, Municipal, Cigar City and Negro Leagues. The museum will celebrate Tampa's baseball heritage with permanent and visiting exhibits. The house was moved from its original location at 1210 E 12th Ave to the museum dedicated lot at the corner of Ninth Avenue and 19th Street. ==Famous Baseball Players from Tampa== Other than Al Lopez, Tampa was home to many other baseball players including Lou Piniella, Tony La Russa, and Tino Martinez. ==References== ==External links== * Tampa Baseball Museum Category:Proposed museums in the United States Category:Baseball in Florida Category:Sports in Tampa, Florida
