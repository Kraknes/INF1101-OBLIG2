Its companion document, National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD-38), was signed in secret by George W. Bush the following year. Although the contents of NSPD 38 are still undisclosed, the U.S. military did not recognize cyberspace as a "theater of operations" until the U.S. National Defense Strategy of 2005.

Released by Edward Snowden and posted by The Guardian, it is part of the 2013 Mass Surveillance Disclosures. While the U.S. factsheet claims PPD-20 acts within the law and is, "consistent with the values that we promote domestically and internationally as we have previously articulated in the International Strategy for Cyberspace", it doesn't reveal cyber operations in the directive.

The development and sustainment of OCEO capabilities, however, may require considerable time and effort if access and tools for a specific target do not already exist." * "The United States Government shall identify potential targets of national importance where OCEO can offer a favorable balance of effectiveness and risk as compared with other instruments of national power, establish and maintain OCEO capabilities integrated as appropriate with other U.S. offensive capabilities, and execute those capabilities in a manner consistent with the provisions of this directive." == Further reading == * 2013 Mass Surveillance Disclosures * Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative == External links == * Guardian: Presidential Policy Directive 20 (PPD) * FAS: White House PPD-20 Factsheet ==See also== *Cyberwarfare in the United States == References == Category:United States national security directives Category:United States national security policy Category:National Security Agency Category:Presidency of Barack Obama Category:Obama administration controversies Category:2013 controversies Category:Cyberattacks Category:Cyberwarfare in the United States Category:Computer security procedures
