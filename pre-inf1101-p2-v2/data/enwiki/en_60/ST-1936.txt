ST-1936 (2-methyl-5-chloro-N,N-dimethyltryptamine) is a tryptamine derivative which is used in scientific research. It acts as a selective 5-HT6 receptor agonist, with a Ki of 13 nM, and much weaker action at 5-HT2B and 5-HT7 subtypes. In animal studies it has been found to increase dopamine and noradrenaline mediated signalling but decreases glutamatergic transmission, and has antidepressant effects. == See also == * EMD-386,088 * EMDT * 5-Bromo- DMT * 5-Chloro-AMT == References == Category:Serotonin receptor agonists Category:Tryptamines Category:Chloroarenes
