His research interests are in aerospace controls systems, including flexible space structure control, control of noise and vibration, especially in helicopters, and the development of smart material actuators. He is the coauthor of seven patents, mostly in the area of smart material actuation. His teaching includes graduate and undergraduate subjects in signals and systems, control theory, guidance and navigation, and flight mechanics and control. Hall was the lead instructor for the Unified Engineering course freely available through MIT OpenCourseWare. == Personal life == He grew up in Florida, living in a half dozen towns throughout the central part of the state before graduating from high school in St. Petersburg, Florida. Living in Florida at the height of the space race, he developed an interest in aircraft and rockets early in life.
