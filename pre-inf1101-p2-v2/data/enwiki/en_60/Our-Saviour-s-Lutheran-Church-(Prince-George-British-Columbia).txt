Our Saviour's Lutheran Church is a Lutheran church located in Prince George, British Columbia. ==History== Our Saviour's Lutheran Church was established on May 12, 1956, as a mission congregation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church (United States) (ELC). It was the policy of the ELC to send a man to buy property, arrange for the building of a parsonage, and then to call a pastor. Dr. Mars Dale, ELC District President, and Pastor C. Solberg, Regional director of Home Missions, were sent out to Prince George to buy property.E.L.C Parish Records of Our Saviour's Lutheran Church of Prince George BC: XII.
