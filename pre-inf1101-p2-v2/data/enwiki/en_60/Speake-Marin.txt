Peter Speake-Marin Speake-Marin is a watchmaking company specializing in high- end timepieces. It was founded in 2002 by English watchmaker Peter Speake- Marin and is based in Geneva, Switzerland. ==History== Peter Speake-Marin was born Peter Neville Speake in 1968 in Essex, England, to an English mother and Welsh father. After graduating as a watchmaker from Hackney Technical College in London in 1985, Speake-Marin went to Switzerland to do an in-depth course in horological complications at the WOSTEP school in Neuchatel.http://www.bhi.co.uk/sites/default/files/Speake%20Marin.pdf He then returned to London and joined Somlo Antiques, heading the antique watch restoration department. After seven years at Somlo, Speake-Marin went back to Switzerland in 1996 to develop and build high-end complications for Renaud & Papi (now Audemars Piguet Renaud & Papi SA). Peter founded Speake-Marin SA in 2002 in Bursins Switzerland. In 2015 a new movement strategy was initiated to fully develop and assemble in-house manufacture movements within its atelier in the Neuchatel area, Switzerland. Peter Speake-Marin left the company in 2017 and was replaced by the actual CEO, Christelle Rosnoblet (already administrator since 2012) and an owner of the company. In 2019, the headquarters were moved from Bursins to Geneva. == Key Timepieces == Since the launch of Speake-Marin, the Speake-Marin collection has grown from time-only wristwatches to include models with a single hand; date; jumping hours; perpetual calendars; tourbillons and minute repeaters; while featuring fired- enamel; semi-skeletonised; hand-engraved; and multi-level dials. ==The Foundation Watch== The first timepiece to bear the Speake-Marin name was a hand-made tourbillon pocket watch, called the Foundation Watch because it formed a template for future Speake-Marin watches through the spade shaped hands and pleated crown, watchmaker's topping-tool motif, (here in the shape of the tourbillon cage) and hand-engraving.[Journal.hautehorlogerie.org, Peter Speake-Marin Dream Merchant http://journal.hautehorlogerie.org/en/article/peter-speake-marin-dream- merchant/] Completing this unique piece helped Peter Speake-Marin to become a member of the Academie Horlogere des Createurs Independants (AHCI)[Skellern, Ian (July 2010) "An Anglo-Swiss Affair http://www.speake- marin.com/images/articles/speake-marin.php] and it set the 'foundation'paved for the Speake-Marin collection.[Goldsmith, Meehna (17 January 2012) watchmatchmaker.com You've Come a Long Way, Baby: Speake-Marin Introduces the Renaissance ==The Original Piccadilly== Launched in 2002, Peter Speake-Marin's first wristwatch was the Piccadilly.monochrome.nl The Speake-Marin Original Piccadilly Collection with Enamel Dial Various Piccadilly series and unique pieces have been created since, the first of which was the Original Piccadilly featuring enamel dial.
