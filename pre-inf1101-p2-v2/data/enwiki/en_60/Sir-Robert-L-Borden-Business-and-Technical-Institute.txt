Sir Robert L. Borden Business and Technical Institute is a dormant high school facility located in the Scarborough district of Toronto, Ontario, Canada that formerly served as a technical public high school. It was established by the Scarborough Board of Education which later merged into the present Toronto District School Board from 1966 to 2016. The school was named after Robert Borden, a Canadian lawyer and politician who was the eighth Prime Minister of Canada from 1911 to 1920. The motto of Sir Robert L. Borden was Auspicium Melioris Aevi (Hope for a Better Age). The school ceased to exist at the end of the 2015-16 academic year end due to declining admissions. Future use of the building remains uncertain.https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/education/2016/06/23/borden- high-school-quietly-closes-as-it-celebrates-50th-anniversary.html ==History== Sir Robert L.
