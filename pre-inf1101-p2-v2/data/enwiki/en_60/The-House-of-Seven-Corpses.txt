The House of Seven Corpses is a 1974 American horror film directed by Paul Harrison and starring John Ireland, Faith Domergue and John Carradine. ==Plot== A director courts disaster by filming his horror movie in a real haunted house. In the midst of the film a zombie (in the credits referenced to as "The Ghoul") is awoken by a magical chant from The Book of the Dead. Actress Faith Domergue, who plays an actress playing a Satan worshipper, reads from a copy of the Tibetan Book of the Dead and chants: "Exsurgent mortui et ad me veniunt" (which in Latin translates to "may the dead rise and come to me" (CQ)). The creature starts thus by killing everyone in and around the house (Starting with Price, who ventured upon the graveyard after hearing something suspicious). At the same time Eric the Director and his assistant David head for the graveyard, to shoot some shots. On arrival they discover the body of Price, and to his horror Eric discovers an (previously unnamed) eight grave that bears David's name. After a struggle with the latter, David emerges from this grave as a zombie. The entire crew, including Eric, who has fled from "David", are killed by the zombie. The film ends with zombie "David" who finds his drowned girlfriend Anne floating in a nearby pond. While the credits start to roll David is seen taking Anne with him to his grave. ==Cast== ==Production== It was filmed at the Utah Governor's Mansion in Salt Lake City. ==Release== Severin Films released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in 2013. ==Reception== Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, academic Peter Dendle called the film "routine but capably handled". Writing in Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide, Glenn Kay called the concept better suited to an anthology film. Bloody Disgusting rated it 1.5/5 stars and wrote that though it is "only frightening in the first few minutes". Stuart Galbraith of DVD Talk rated it 2/5 stars and called it "cheap and derivative but hard to entirely dislike". Daryl Loomis of DVD Verdict wrote, "While there are things to enjoy about The House of Seven Corpses, it is completely forgettable, mostly because it's patently unscary." ==See also== * List of American films of 1974 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1974 films Category:1974 directorial debut films Category:1974 horror films Category:1974 independent films Category:1970s supernatural horror films Category:American films Category:American haunted house films Category:American independent films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:American zombie films Category:English-language films Category:Films about filmmaking Category:Films set in country houses Category:Films shot in Salt Lake City
