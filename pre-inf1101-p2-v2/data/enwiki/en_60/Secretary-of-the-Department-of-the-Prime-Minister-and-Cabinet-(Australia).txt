On taking office as Prime Minister in 1971, William McMahon reversed Gorton's changes and restored earlier changes via the creation of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. A lesser role of Secretary to the Department of the Vice-President of the Executive Council was established for a short time; abolished in the early days of the Whitlam government. Upon election to office in 1996, John Howard established a separate Cabinet Office within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The Cabinet Office was a small unit, staffed from within and outside the public service, which provided the Prime Minister with advice on issues before Cabinet as well as strategic policy directions. ===Secretary to the Department of the Cabinet Office=== {| class="wikitable" !width=5 | Order ||width=150 | Name ||width=450 | Title ||width=120 | Date appointment commenced ||width=120 | Date appointment ceased ||width=120 | Term in office ||width=10 | Ref(s) |- |align=center|1 || Sir John Bunting || Secretary to the Department of the Cabinet Office ||align=center| ||align=center| ||align=right | || |- !colspan=7 style="background: #cccccc;" | |- |align=center|2 || Michael L'Estrange || Secretary to the Cabinet and Head of the Cabinet Policy Unit ||align=center| ||align=center| ||align=right| || |- |} ===Secretary to the Department of the Vice-President of the Executive Council=== {| class="wikitable" !width=5 | Order ||width=150 | Name ||width=450 | Title ||width=120 | Date appointment commenced ||width=120 | Date appointment ceased ||width=120 | Term in office ||width=10 | Ref(s) |- |align=center|1 || Sir Lenox Hewitt || Secretary to the Department of the Vice-President of the Executive Council ||align=center| ||align=center| ||align=right | || |- |} ==References== Category:Department of the Prime Minister (Australia)
