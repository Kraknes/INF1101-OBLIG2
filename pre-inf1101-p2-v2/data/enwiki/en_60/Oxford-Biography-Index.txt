The Oxford Biography Index is an Oxford University Press (OUP) authority file. Although the index itself does not require registration, content linked from the index does. Originally a British national authority file based on the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford DNB), it had been expanded to index some content from the American National Biography (ANB). ==External links== * (no longer available) Category:Identifiers
