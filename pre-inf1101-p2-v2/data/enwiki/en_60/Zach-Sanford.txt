Zachary Michael Sanford (born November 9, 1994) is an American professional ice hockey forward currently playing for the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League (NHL). Sanford won the Stanley Cup as a member of the Blues in 2019. ==Playing career== ===Early career=== Sanford was born in Salem, Massachusetts before moving to Manchester, New Hampshire and attending Pinkerton Academy. During the 2011-12 season at Pinkerton, Sanford led the team to a Division 1 state title with 36 goals and 69 points. After earning the honor of New Hampshire High School Player of the Year, Sanford joined the Islanders Hockey Club of the Eastern Junior Hockey League (EJHL), recording 36 points in 37 games. While with the Islanders, Sanford committed to play collegiate hockey for the Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in March 2013. During his first year of NHL draft eligibility, Sanford started off ranking 83rd amongst North American skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau but soon raised his rank to 60th overall. He was shortly thereafter picked in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft in the second round, 61st overall by the Washington Capitals. After being drafted 61st overall in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft by the Washington Capitals, Sanford joined the Waterloo Black Hawks of the United States Hockey League. ===Collegiate=== Sanford officially joined the Boston Eagles for the 2014-15 season where he scored 24 points in 38 games. He recorded his first collegiate goal on November 14 against Michigan State in a 3-2 win. He finished the season tied for fourth on the team with 17 assists. In his sophomore season with the Eagles in 2015-16, Sanford continued his offensive output and recorded 39 points in 40 games as the team qualified for the Frozen Four. On July 11, 2016, Sanford embarked on his professional career in signing a three-year, entry-level contract with the Washington Capitals. ===Professional=== After attending the Capitals training camp and having made an impact in the pre-season, Sanford made the Capitals opening night roster for the 2016-17 season. He made his NHL debut on October 13, 2016, against the defending Stanley Cup Champion Pittsburgh Penguins and had one shot on goal. After being sent down to AHL affiliate, the Hershey Bears, he was recalled up to the NHL on February 10. He scored his first career NHL goal on February 11, 2017 against the Anaheim Ducks. Sanford added another goal and assist in 26 games with the Capitals before he was traded to the St. Louis Blues as part of a package for defenceman Kevin Shattenkirk on February 27, 2017. Sanford scored his first goal as a Blue on March 16, 2017, against the San Jose Sharks in a 4-1 win. During a Blues practice on December 10, 2018, Sanford fought teammate Robert Bortuzzo. The two got a few punches in on one another before being separated by coaches. At the time, St. Louis had lost eight of their last 11 games. By January 2019, the Blues were in last place around the entire league resulting in a coaching and goaltender change. The changes proved to be successful as Sanford ended the regular season playing in 60 regular-season games and accumulating 20 points and the team qualified for the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs. As the Blues met the Bruins in the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals, Sanford recorded his only goal of the postseason during Game 7 as the Blues earned their first Stanley Cup in their 52-year franchise history. The following season, Sanford achieved a rare four-goal performance in a 6-5 loss to the Vegas Golden Knights. It was also Sanford's first career hat trick and the first time a Blues' player scored four goals in a game in over five years. ==Career statistics== {| border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" style="text-align:center; width:60em" |- bgcolor="#e0e0e0" ! colspan="3" bgcolor="#ffffff" | ! rowspan="99" bgcolor="#ffffff" | ! colspan="5" | Regular season ! rowspan="99" bgcolor="#ffffff" | ! colspan="5" | Playoffs |- bgcolor="#e0e0e0" !
