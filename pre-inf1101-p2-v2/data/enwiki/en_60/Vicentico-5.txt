Vicentico 5 (2012) is the fifth album by Argentine rock and pop singer- songwriter Vicentico. ==Reception== The AllMusic review by Mariano Prunes awarded the album 4 stars, stating: "Overall in 5, Vicentico continues to do as he pleases at the risk of confusing his fan base - his latter-day mainstream Latin-American audience will not find much to dance to in this album, and the rock/ska/punk crowd to which he originally belonged is not going to welcome the prodigal son with open arms if he insists on covering acts such as ABBA, Roberto Carlos, and Xuxa all in the same album - but hey, so far it has worked wonders for his solo career, both in commercial and artistic terms".Prunes, M.
