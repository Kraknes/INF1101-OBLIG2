According to a description of the scenes, "Halperin crawls through his piano, then wanders through a field, drives an old convertible down a suburban road, wanders across a movie set, finds himself at a birthday party and plunges underwater. He eventually winds up in a forest at night, wearing a white suit and coattails as people dance underneath bright lights hanging from trees." == Track listing == == References == ==External links== *Tim Halperin on Facebook (Official) * (Official) Category:2011 albums Category:Tim Halperin albums Category:24 Hour Distribution albums
