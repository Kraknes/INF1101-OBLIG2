The race has had a number of different courses. In the early life of the race the course began in Schengen and finished in Wormeldange. This changed in 1975 to begin in Remich and end at Grevenmacher. The current course (with a start and finish in Remich) was first put to use in 2000. The distance of the race has also varied: it was not reliably measured for the half marathon distance until 1995. The first four editions were too long, as was the 1972 race. From 1966 to 1979, the courses were generally short and from 1979 to 1999 the times run on the course were aided by an overall downhill elevation. Since 2000, the times set on the course have been eligible for record making purposes.Route du Vin Half Marathon. Association of Road Racing Statisticians (2013-10-01). Retrieved on 2013-10-05.
