Passport must be valid for 6 months from arrival and visitors must hold return or onward ticket. ==Visa policy map == Visa policy of Bahrain ==Reform== In October 2014, Bahrain implemented a new visa policy that makes it easier for incoming travelers to get Bahraini visas. Travelers must have a passport that is valid for at least six months and a visa to enter Bahrain. However, travelers from approved countries can now get their visas online or when they arrive in the country. Bahrain has issued more visas since the policy was implemented than it did before. Starting in April 2015, Bahrain began sending applicants confirmations of their application status by text messaging. In November 2016, Bahrain adopted new visa policy rules defining a two-week allowed stay on a single entry visa and a 90-day stay on a multiple entry visa valid for one year. In addition, a multiple entry visa valid for three months allows stay for one month. Citizens of Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom and United States may obtain a five-year multiple entry visa allowing a 90-day stay on each visit.Bahrain launches two new visas for 114 countries == Visa exemption == Citizens of the following GCC countries except Qatar do not require a visa to visit Bahrain and may use National ID Cards to enter the country: {|style=" ; background-color: white; border: 1px solid white; padding: 5px;" |- style="vertical-align:top;" | * * * * | |} Visa exemption also applies to holders of diplomatic and special passports of China, India, and Israelhttps://mfa.gov.il/MFA/PressRoom/2020/Pages/Israel-and-Bahrain-sign- Memorandums-of-Understanding-18-October-2020.aspx.
