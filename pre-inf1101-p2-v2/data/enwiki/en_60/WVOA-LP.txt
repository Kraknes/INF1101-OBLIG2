A few secular music programs also air, primarily on weekends. Despite a similarity in call signs, there is no relation between WVOA-LP and the Voice of America service. The VOA call sign was requested when the station changed to a Classical music format in the late 80's. The WVOA call sign was retained when the station was returned to Christian Broadcasting about 2 years later. ==References== ==External links== *WVOARadio.com - Official Web site * * VOA-LP Category:Craig Fox stations
