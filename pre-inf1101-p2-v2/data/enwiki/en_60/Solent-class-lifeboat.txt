{| |} The Solent-class lifeboat is a steel-hulled version of the 48ft 6in Oakley-class self-righting lifeboat and is sometimes referred to as the 48'6" Oakley-class Mark III.Rescue at Sea - An International History of Lifesaving, Coastal Rescue Craft and Organisations. Author: Evans, Clayton. Publisher: Conway Maritime Press - Chrysalis Books Plc. 2003. Work= Part II, Chapter 19 - To Right or Not to Right? Page 161. Solent Operational Numbers followed on from the first three 48ft 6in Oakleys and were interrupted by the last two Oakleys (48-12 and 48-13). The operational numbers of the Solent-class had three digits in the suffix to indicate a metal hull (as with Clyde, Waveney, Thames, Tyne classes, one Arun class and the first eleven Merseys). Two digits indicates a wooden, GRP or FRC hull. == Description == Apart from the steel hull the principal difference to the wooden hulled Oakley was the elimination of the complicated water ballast self-righting system; the Solent derived its self-righting capability from its watertight superstructure. The class was the last design of the traditional displacement-type lifeboat to come from the drawing boards of the RNLI. There were (unofficial) Mark I and Mark II versions of the class, the first eight boats having a vertical steering wheel with wheelhouse access via sliding doors at the forward end of the wheelhouse on each side, while the last three has a seated steering position with hinged wheelhouse doors at the after end of the wheelhouse. The Mark II entered service in 1972. The first four boats (ON 1007-1010) and the last three (ON 1019-1021) were built at Cowes by Groves & Guttridge. The second four (ON 1011-1014) were built at Gosport by Camper & Nicholson. === Propulsion === The Solent was powered by twin 110 bhp Gardner 6LX diesel engines which gave the boat a top speed of . There were twin spade rudders installed which were coupled to Mathway manual steering gear which gave this class a much better manoeuvrability than earlier classes of lifeboats. == Fleet == {|class="wikitable" !
