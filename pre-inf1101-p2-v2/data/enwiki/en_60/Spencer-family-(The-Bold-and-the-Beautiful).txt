It started as one magazine, Eye on Fashion, by Bill Spencer and eventually grew to include numerous businesses as Spencer Publications took control of its own distribution, marketing, and advertising. It diversified and evolved, investigating green printing and with the growth of the Internet took the business into cyberspace. For years Spencer Publications founder Bill Spencer ruthlessly ran it as Chairman and CEO in Los Angeles then in New York City. His two living children, Karen Spencer and Bill Spencer Jr., worked their way up and upon their father's death Karen and Bill each received 50% ownership and were named co-CEO. Bill's wife Katie Logan became CEO after their divorce papers were signed, Bill gave Katie 1% ownership which made Bill's ownership 49%. Katie combined her 1% with Karen's 50% making Karen the majority stockholder. After Bill reconciled with Katie she signed legal papers naming him CEO again and giving him equal custody of their son Will but Bill revealed it was an act to gain control of Spencer Publications and equal custody of Will. When Katie's sister Brooke discovered Bill's actions she destroyed the papers. Months later after unsuccessfully trying to get Karen and Katie to reinstate Bill as CEO Brooke revealed she still had the papers and gave them to Bill, thus removing Katie as CEO and reinstating Bill as CEO and giving him equal custody of Will. ===Personnel=== * Karen Spencer (50% shareholder) * Bill Spencer Jr. (49% shareholder, CEO) * Wyatt Spencer (Executive) * Katie Logan (1% shareholder, Vice President) * Justin Barber (Executive Vice President) * Alison Montgomery (Assistant) * George Satalino (Board member) ===Former employees=== * Bill Spencer Sr. (Founder, Chairman, and CEO) * Katie Logan (CEO) * Liam Spencer (Editor of Eye on Fashion, President, acting CEO) * Wyatt Spencer (President) ==Spencer sword necklace== Bill Spencer Jr. wore a sword necklace that was made a jewelry designer Quinn Fuller and it became a symbol of his determination and ruthlessness. When he discovered that Liam Spencer was his son he had an identical sword necklace made for Liam and it became a family trait for Spencer men to wear a sword necklace. When Hope Logan met Wyatt Spencer in Big Bear she saw that he wore a sword necklace identical to Bill and Liam's. This would reveal that Wyatt is Bill's son. In November 2018, Bill admits that he initially started wearing his sword necklace as a symbol of protection against his father Bill Spencer, Sr. then to be a warrior and fight on against an enemy. == References == Category:The Bold and the Beautiful families Category:Television characters introduced in 1987
