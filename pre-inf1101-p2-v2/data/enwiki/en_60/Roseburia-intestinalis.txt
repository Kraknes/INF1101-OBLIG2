Roseburia intestinalis is a saccharolytic, butyrate-producing bacterium first isolated from human faeces. It is anaerobic, gram-positive, non-sporeforming, slightly curved rod-shaped and motile by means of multiple subterminal flagella. L1-82T (= DSM 14610T = NCIMB 13810T) is the type strain. ==References== ==Further reading== *Staley, James T., et al.
