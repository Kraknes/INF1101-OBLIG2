French soldiers firing the Puteaux Mle.1905 machine gun on maneuvers The Puteaux Model APX 1905 Machine Gun was an early attempt to create a feasible machine gun for the French Army. Designed by officers at the Atelier de Construction de Puteaux, it turned out to be an unsuccessful design. == Design == Completely radical to the Hotchkiss guns, the Puteaux failed in reliability, simplicity, and the general ability to perform credibly. With an adjustable firing rate of thirty to six hundred rounds per minute, it fired the 8mm Lebel round, the same used in the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun (Mle 1900). The feed system consisted of several metal strips of ammunition fed in, also the same as the Hotchkiss, but not without several modifications. Very few M1905s were delivered and it was scarcely used in battle. The gun was such a failure that it was immediately redesigned as the St. Etienne Mle 1907 machine gun. but this was only marginally better. ==References== ==External links== *World.guns.ru * http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=575 Category:Machine guns of France
