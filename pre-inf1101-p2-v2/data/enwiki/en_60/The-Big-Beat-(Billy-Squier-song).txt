Much of the playing in this song, from the slide guitar to that big booming sound of Chouinard's drums, would become Squier's trademark sound and it is great to hear it before it became too pop.". ==Samples== "The Big Beat" has been sampled in: * Beck - "Soul Suckin' Jerk" * Jay-Z - "99 Problems" * Kanye West and Pusha T - "Looking for Trouble" * Dizzee Rascal - "Fix Up, Look Sharp" * Nas featuring Will.i.am - "Hip Hop is Dead" * Puff Daddy - "Can't Nobody Hold Me Down" * A Tribe Called Quest - "We Can Get Down" * Big Daddy Kane - "Put Your Weight On It," "Get Down," "Ain't No Half Steppin," "The Beef Is On" and "3 Forties and a Bottle of Moet" * Ice Cube - "Jackin' for Beats" * Alicia Keys - "Girl on Fire" * Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five - "Magic Carpet Ride" * Whistle - I Am (1992) * Run-D.M.C - "Here We Go" * Unkle - "The Knock" * UTFO - "Roxanne, Roxanne" * Red Hot Chili Peppers - "Higher Ground (X-Ecutioners Remix)" * Alessia Cara - Scars to Your Beautiful The track opens The Prodigy's The Dirtchamber Sessions Volume One mix. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1980 songs Category:Songs written by Billy Squier Category:Billy Squier songs Category:Sampled drum breaks
