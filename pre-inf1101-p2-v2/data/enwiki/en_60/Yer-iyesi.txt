E.M. Meletinskii - M.:'Sovetskaia entsiklopediia', 1990 g.- 672 s. It is akin of Yer iyesi. The word originates in the Pre-Christian Chuvash mythology but in the modern usage it has only one meaning. The confusion in the name's Etymology owes to the fact that a Turkic word Yer means land or earth, while the word Yerlesmek is a verb that means to locate. Early in the 20th century Yereh combined a prehistoric Scythian earth-goddess and Mother Earth. Today she is identified as a combination of the "hearth-mother" (associated with the guardianship of the nation itself) and the earth mother. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Hristiyanlastirilan Turkler (Cuvaslar), Durmus Arik, Aziz Andac Yayinevi * Turk Mitolojisi Ansiklopedik Sozluk, Celal Beydili, Yurt Yayinevi ==External links== * Mifologiia, Tatarskaia mifologiia - Zhir iiase * MIFOLOGIChESKII SLOVAR' - Ierekh Category:Iye
