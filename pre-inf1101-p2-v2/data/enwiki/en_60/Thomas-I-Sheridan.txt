Thomas I. Sheridan (c. 1890 in New York City - c. 1962) was an American lawyer and politician from New York. ==Life== He attended Xavier High School and College, graduating A.B. in 1909. He graduated LL.B. from Fordham Law School in 1911, was admitted to the bar in 1912, and practiced in New York City, at times in partnership with Ferdinand Pecora and Joab H. Banton. He married Marie A. Galligan (died 1955), and they had several children. Sheridan entered politics as a Democrat, and was appointed by D.A. Edward Swann as an Assistant New York County District Attorney. He resigned on November 30, 1920, and resumed his private practice. He was a member of the New York State Senate (16th D.) from 1922 to 1930, sitting in the 145th, 146th, 147th, 148th, 149th, 150th, 151st, 152nd and 153rd New York State Legislatures; and was Chairman of the Committee on Taxation and Retrenchment from 1923 to 1924.
