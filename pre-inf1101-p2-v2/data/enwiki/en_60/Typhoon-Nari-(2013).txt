Typhoon Nari (), known in the Philippines as Typhoon Santi, was a strong and deadly tropical cyclone that first struck Luzon before striking Vietnam. The storm was the 41st depression and the 8th typhoon in the 2013 typhoon season. Typhoon Nari was a deadly typhoon that made landfall in the Philippines and Vietnam. ==Meteorological history== On October 8, 2013 the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started to monitor a tropical depression, that developed within an area of low to moderate vertical windshear, about to the southwest of Manila on the Philippine island of Luzon. The system was subsequently named Santi by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) as it moved along the southern edge of a subtropical ridge of high pressure. Later that day the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Depression 24W after the systems low level circulation center had started to consolidate. During the next day after central convection over the systems low level circulation centre had increased both the JMA and the JTWC reported that the depression had developed into a tropical storm, with the latter naming it as Nari. ==Preparations and impact== ===Philippines=== During October 9, PAGASA issued the public storm warning signal number 1 for the island province of Catanduanes, before expanding the areas under Signal 1 early the next day to include Aurora, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Isabela, the Polilio Islands and Quezon. Later that day after the system had intensified into a typhoon and accelerated slightly towards the Philippines slightly, PAGASA placed 17 areas in Luzon under Signal 1, 14 areas under Signal 2 and Aurora Province under Signal 3. During October 11, the areas under signal 3 were expanded to include Benguet, Ifugao, Ilocos Sur, Isabela, La Union, Pangasinan, Polilio Island, Quirino, Nueva Ecija and Tarlac. Over the next day, the warnings were gradually revised before they were all subsequently cancelled during October 12, as the system moved out of the Philippine Area of Responsibility and was moving towards Vietnam. Within the Philippines a total of 15 people were left dead while 5 were missing, while total economic losses were amounted to be Php3.3 billion (US$77 million). ===Vietnam=== A typhoon that left a lot of damage in Vietnam In advance of the typhoon, more than 122,000 residents were evacuated from vulnerable provinces to higher grounds. In Danang, soldiers were sent to help people readily secure their homes against the expected winds and guide ships to shelter. Thousands of travelers were left stranded as Vietnam Airlines cancelled over a dozen flights. The system moved ashore early on October 5, claiming 19 lives, while total economic losses were amounted to be VND1.6 trillion (US$76 million). ===Laos=== On October 16, poor weather from the remnants of Typhoon Nari has been cited as a probable cause for the crash of Lao Airlines Flight 301, on approach to Pakse International Airport with the loss of all 49 passengers and crew. Another 4 people were killed directly due to the storm. ===China=== Total damages in China were counted to be CNY=50 million (US$8.19 million). ==Retirement== PAGASA announced that the name Santi, would be retired from its naming lists after it had caused over P1 billion in damages. PAGASA chose the name Salome to replace Santi for the 2017 season. ==See also== *Typhoon Vongfong (2020) *Tropical Depression 18W (2013) *Typhoon Ketsana *Typhoon Mirinae (2009) *Typhoon Xangsane *Typhoon Wutip (2013) ==References== ==External links== *JMA General Information of Typhoon Nari (1325) from Digital Typhoon *JMA Best Track Data of Typhoon Nari (1325) *JTWC Best Track Data of Typhoon 24W (Nari) *24W.NARI from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory Category:2013 Pacific typhoon season Category:2013 disasters in the Philippines Category:Typhoons in the Philippines Category:Typhoons in Vietnam Category:Typhoons in Laos Category:Typhoons Nari
