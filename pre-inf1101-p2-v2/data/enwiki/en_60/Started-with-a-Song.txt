Started with a Song was nominated for Country Album of the Year at the 2014 Juno Awards. ==Critical reception== Amanda Ash of the Edmonton Journal gave the album four stars out of five, calling it "a wham-bam collection of 10 sweeping love songs and lively party anthems that leave you glossy-eyed and daydream drunk." Ash wrote that "his songs like to play hooky with pop punches and rock growls, making for a cross-genre record that will surely befriend a very large audience." ==Track listing== ==Chart performance== ===Album=== {| class="wikitable" |- !
