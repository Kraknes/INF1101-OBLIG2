On 29 May 2013, Miranda gave the Electoral Service of Chile the requested signatures to legalize the Partido Igualdad, and as a consequence, formalizing her candidacy. Miranda presented her government program, the last presidential candidate to do so, on 5 November 2013, which was centered in four areas related to social reforms. The 125-page document was introduced by Miranda Meneses "with proud (...) to begin, through the next four years, the profound transformation of Chile," and described it as a "plebeian program, of the people who wakes up and begins to organize itself to struggle for a better country". The four main areas of Roxana Miranda's program were titled: "Superacion del capitalismo" (Overcoming capitalism), "Que el pueblo mande" (Let the people rule), "Recuperacion de nuestros derechos" (recovering our rights), and "El buen vivir" (Good living). She lost the election. ==References== ==External links== * Official campaign web site Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:People from Santiago Category:Chilean activists Category:Chilean women activists Category:Candidates for President of Chile Category:Chilean women in politics Category:21st-century Chilean politicians Category:21st-century Chilean women politicians
