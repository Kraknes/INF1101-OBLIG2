Sounds from far-flung places are projected through instruments to the visitor's peripersonal space through motion detecting sensors.zero1biennial.org Body Envelope She also uses motion detectors to promote audience participation in her performances in Space Shifter which is composed of twelve sensory cables that bend in the form of a portal and are suspended against a wall.EditionedArt Nina Waisman As visitors move their bodies within the portal of sensors, sound is emitted. The pitch, speed, volume, and quality of the sound changes according to the visitor's physical proximity to the sensors. Nina Waisman pulls many of her soundscapes from Tijuana, Mexico. In MediaWomb, Waisman uses recycled cardboard in the form of egg cartons to create an encasing womblike sculpture; one side of the sculpture emits local soundscapes of Tijuana while the other side emits global soundscapes of the media. Within the sculpture, visitors sits at opposite sides facing each other. Depending on the side the visitor is sitting on, they experience the sculpture differently. Visitor interaction is also apparent in her earlier work Between Bodies in 2008. It's an interactive sound and sculpture installation that brings the busy atmosphere of Tijuana to the visitors through speakers. As visitors move through the hall way filled with these instruments, they are transported metaphysically to Tijuana. The sounds range from the noises in the streets created by cars to local human activity.Felipe Zuniga Between Bodies.
