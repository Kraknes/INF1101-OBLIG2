{| |} The Young Skyheater is an American aircraft that was designed by Ed Young for homebuilt construction. ==Design and development== The Skyheater is a two-seat, single engine, conventional landing gear-equipped, parasol wing aircraft. Rather than a separate distinct vertical tail section, the Skyheater fuselage is tapered only along its sides, leaving a square tail or full-height dorsal fin extending to the wing root. The fuselage is constructed of welded steel tubing with fabric covered control surfaces. The wings are of all aluminum construction. ==Specifications (Young Skyheater) == ==See also== ==References== Category:Homebuilt aircraft
