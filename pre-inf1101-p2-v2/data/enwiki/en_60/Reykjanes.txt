Svartsengi Power Station on Reykjanes Reykjanes is a small headland on the southwestern tip of Reykjanesskagi in Iceland. The region is about from Iceland's international airport. There was a prolonged period of constant volcanic activity on the peninsula, the Reykjanes Fires, from the 10th to the 13th century; between 1210 and 1240 about 50 square km of land were covered in lava. The area is fed by five volcanic systems; geological evidence suggests that they seem to activate in a coordinated way about every 1,000 years. In the twelve weeks from 21 January 2020, after centuries of relative inactivity, there were more than 8,000 earthquakes and about 10 cm of land uplift due to underground magma intrusions on the peninsula, leading to concerns of a new phase of activity which could cause disruption for centuries. As the name means "smoking peninsula" connected to volcanic activity, there are also other peninsulas by this name in Iceland, eg. the peninsula of Reykjanes in Isafjardardjup. ==References== ==External links== * Catalogue of Icelandic Volcanoes - Reykjanes Category:Headlands of Iceland Category:Peninsulas of Iceland
