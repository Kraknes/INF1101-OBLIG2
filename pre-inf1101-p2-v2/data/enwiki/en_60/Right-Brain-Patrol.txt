Right Brain Patrol, put out on JMT label, is a studio album by jazz acoustic bassist Marc Johnson and the first with his trio featuring guitarist Ben Monder and percussionist and singer Arto Tuncboyaciyan. Jazz Music Today released the album in 1992. ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Sean Westergaard awarded the album 2 1/2 stars, stating "Right Brain Patrol features Marc Johnson in a trio setting with guitarist Ben Monder (among his first recordings) and percussionist Arto Tuncboyaciyan. Johnson is a fabulous bass player with a rich tone. Monder's playing contains shades of Bill Frisell's tone and harmonic sensibility. Tuncboyaciyan is a fine percussionist, but listeners will either love or hate the vocalizing he does on a handful of cuts. "Batuki Burundi" is a solo bass vehicle, and Johnson and Tuncboyaciyan basically divide the rest of the composing duties, with Monder contributing one piece and sharing credits on two more. The bass and guitar playing are stellar throughout, even if Monder sounds a bit derivative in this early session ("Netcong on My Mind" and "Whispers" wouldn't sound out of place on a Bill Frisell album). The title cut has Monder and Johnson trading off leads and support in a lively conversation. "Heru Nazel" has some nice arco bass work and great guitar, but also has some of the aforementioned vocals. "After You" has Johnson playing some great lead over a queasy guitar figure. Few of these tunes will really stick in your head, but they are well played and quite beautiful at times." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Band *Marc Johnson - upright bass *Ben Monder - electric & acoustic guitars *Arto Tuncboyaciyan - percussions & vocals Production *Steve Byram - cover painting, design *Colin George - artwork, cover art *Gunter Mattei - cover design *Cheung Ching Ming - photography *Adrian von Ripka - mastering *David Schiffman - assistant engineer *Justin Luchter - assistant engineer, engineer *James Farber - engineer *Stefan F.
