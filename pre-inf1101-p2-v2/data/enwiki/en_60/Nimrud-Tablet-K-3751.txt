The Nimrud Tablet K.3751, also known as Kalhu Palace Summary Inscription 7 is an inscription on a clay tablet dated c.733 BC from the reign of Tiglath- Pileser III (745 to 727 BC), discovered by George Smith in 1873 in Nimrud.The Philistines in Transition: A History from Ca. 1000-730 B.C.E., Carl S. Ehrlich p174 The tablet describes the first 17 years of Tiglath-Pileser III's reign, and was likely composed in or shortly after his 17th year.Tadmor 1994:154, 238-259) It contains the first known archeological reference to Judah (Yaudaya or KUR.ia-u-da-a-a).The Pitcher Is Broken: Memorial Essays for Gosta W. Ahlstrom, Steven W. Holloway, Lowell K. Handy, Continuum, 1 May 1995 Quote: "For Israel, the description of the battle of Qarqar in the Kurkh Monolith of Shalmaneser III (mid-ninth century) and for Judah, a Tiglath-pileser III text mentioning (Jeho-) Ahaz of Judah (II Rs 16.7 = K. 3751), dated 734-733, are the earliest published to date." The text consists of 50 and 35 lines of inscription on the two main pieces. It is the most detailed of Tiglath-Pileser III's summary inscriptions, and contains the only known complete building account of Tiglath-Pileser III from Nimrud.COS 2, 289, 2.117D Though it has the identification code K 3751, where K stands for Kouyunjik (usually the Library of Ashurbanipal), it was most probably actually discovered at Nimrud since it was inscribed by the excavators with "S.E. Palace Nimroud".Identifying Biblical Persons In Northwest Semitic Inscriptions, Lawrence J. Mykytiuk The most well known excerpt of the text, including the reference to king Ahaz (written in the inscription as Jeho-ahaz, his longer name) of Judah, as translated by the University of Pennsylvania's RINAP project (The Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period), is as below: > "In all of the (foreign) lands that ...
