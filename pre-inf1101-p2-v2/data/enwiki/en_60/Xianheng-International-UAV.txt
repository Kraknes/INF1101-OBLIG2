Xianheng International UAVs are Chinese UAVs developed by Zhejiang Xian-Heng (meaning Everything is Beautiful in Classical Chinese) International General Equipment Co., Ltd. (Xianheng International, Zhe Jiang Xian Heng Guo Ji Tong Yong She Bei You Xian Gong Si ), whose products include both the fixed-wing and rotary-wing UAVs. ==Propitious Cloud== Propitious Cloud (Xiang-Yun or Xiangyun, Xiang Yun ) 1 UAV is a fixed-wing UAV developed by Xianheng International in conventional layout with high-wing configuration, and propulsion is provided by a propeller-driven tractor engine mounted in the nose. Landing gear consists of a pair of skids with wheels attached, so that the UAV can be easily moved around on the ground. Specifications:Propitious Cloud *Length (m): 2 *Wingspan (m): 2.7 *Wing area (m3): 0.86 *Max speed (km/h): 140 *Cruise speed (km/h): 90 *Stall speed (km/h): 50 *Rate of climb (m/s): 5 *Payload (kg): 5 *Endurance (h): 2 - 4 *Ceiling (km): 4 *Launch: taxiing or catapult *Landing: taxiing or parachute *Landing speed (km/h): 50 - 60 ==XH unmanned helicopters== XH series unmanned helicopters are unmanned helicopters developed by Xianheng International in conventional helicopter layouts with a pair of skids as landing gear. XH series utilizes commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) airframe integrated with flight control systems indigenously developed by Xianheng International, and as of 2013, a total of five models have been identified, ranging from the electrically powered XH-1 to fossil fuel powered XH-2/3/4/5.
