William de Bardelby (died 1337) was an English-born judge in Ireland. He took his name from his birthplace, Barlby, North Yorkshire. He was probably a cousin of the William de Bardelby who was Keeper of the Great Seal in the reign of King Edward II. He was vicar of Cubberley in Gloucestershire in 1316; he then moved to Ireland where he was presented to the living of Garristown, in north County Dublin, in 1318. He became Master of the Rolls in Ireland in 1334 (being only the second holder of the office) and held that position until his death in 1337. ==References== *Ball, F.
