Thomas atte Crosse, also called Thomas de Crosse (died after 1348) was an English cleric, Crown official and judge, who had a highly successful career in both England and Ireland. Little is recorded about his early years, but by 1336 he was referred to as an official of long standing who had been put to great "labours and charges" on the King's business in England, Ireland and Scotland. He appears as a prebendary in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin in 1334, and in the same year was made a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland). He was made Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, "so long as he was of good behaviour" in 1335 and held that office for two years. In 1336 in consideration of his long and good service he was appointed Keeper of the Royal Market in Ireland, and Royal Clerk of the Wages. He was assigned the task of .paying the wages of the men at arms being sent to Scotland "to suppress the malice of the King's Scottish enemies" in 1335-6, and with purveying the necessary food and drink for the Scottish campaign. He returned to England in 1337: Ball states that he received many clerical preferments but does not specify them. He was appointed Keeper of the Royal Wardrobe in 1337 and was Chamberlain of the Exchequer from 1337 to 1348. ==References== *Ball, F.
