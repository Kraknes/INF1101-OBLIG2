Paraponera is a genus of ants and the only genus in the subfamily Paraponerinae. The name means "near-Ponera". It consists of two species: the extant Paraponera clavata, also known as a bullet ant, found in the Neotropics, and the very small fossil species Paraponera dieteri known from Dominican amber (Early Miocene; 16-19 million years ago). Bullet ants are so named for the pain caused by their venomous stings. The intensely painful sting is toxic to invertebrates as well as vertebrates and a major component is the neurotoxic peptide poneratoxin. ==Species== * Paraponera clavata (Fabricius, 1775) * +Paraponera dieteri Baroni Urbani, 1994 ==References== ==External links== * Category:Paraponerinae Category:Ant genera Category:Messinian genera Category:Zanclean genera Category:Piacenzian genera Category:Gelasian genera Category:Calabrian genera Category:Ionian genera Category:Tarantian genera Category:Holocene genera
