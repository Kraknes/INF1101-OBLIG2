"Nuestro juramento" is a bolero by Puerto Rican songwriter Benito de Jesus and popularized throughout Latin America by Ecuadorian singer Julio Jaramillo. Jaramillo's original recording of the song was made in 1956, featuring Rosalino Quintero on requinto guitar, and released in 1957 by Onix. Nuestro juramento is the most popular song in the history of Ecuador, especially in Guayaquil, where Julio Jaramillo was from. However, most Ecuadorians are unaware that it was written by someone outside their country. Benito de Jesus said to be living off the royalties of "Nuestro juramento". Every 6 months he received royalties from different countries. ==Other versions== Many singers have sung versions of "Nuestro juramento", including Ecuadorian singer Olimpo Cardenas, Colombian singers Charlie Zaa and Alci Acosta, Peruvian singer Tania Libertad, Puerto Rican singer Daniel Santos, and the Mexican groups Los Baby's and Cafe Tacvba. The latter was in the soundtrack of the movie Cronicas, directed by Sebastian Cordero. ==References== ==External links== * Julio Jaramillo - Nuestro Juramento on YouTube Category:Ecuadorian songs Category:Boleros Category:Spanish-language songs
