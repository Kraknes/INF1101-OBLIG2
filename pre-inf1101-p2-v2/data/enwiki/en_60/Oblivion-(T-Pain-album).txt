Recording sessions for the album took place from 2014 to 2017. ==Critical reception== HipHopDX said, "Fans of T-Pain will find that his fifth go-around is a quality cure for their six-year itch. One thing can be said for the rapper/singer: he never under-delivers -- even if the expectation is for him to totally drop a masterpiece onto the world". ==Track listing== Credits adapted from Tidal and XXL. ==Personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal and XXL.
