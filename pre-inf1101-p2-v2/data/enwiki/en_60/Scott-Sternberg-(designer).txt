He also studied photography. ==Early career== Sternberg began his career in the film business in late 1997, working as an assistant in the motion picture talent department at Creative Artists Agency, where he eventually in 1999 became an agent in the company's New Media and Marketing Division. In 2003, Sternberg left CAA to work with Tom Scott (co-founder and former co-CEO of Nantucket Nectars), Cary Woods (film producer), and Emily Scott (founder and former CEO of J.Crew) on a new consulting and media venture. His brief time working there, specifically with Emily Scott, piqued a long held interest in fashion, which led Sternberg to start Band of Outsiders later that year. ==Band of Outsiders== Sternberg started Band of Outsiders in late 2003 as a line of men's shirts and ties. It has since grown to include womenswear. The brand sells in 225 doors worldwide, including Barneys New York, Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Colette. The line has been described as "recontextualized vintage-inspired looks with hand-sewn seams and shrunken proportions" and "look[s] toward the future by revisiting the past, wistfully but also with a mischievous, ironic wink." On June 15, 2015, Sternberg announced he is leaving the brand via Instagram and that he cannot comment on the future of the brand as it is out of his hands. == Entireworld == On March 27, 2018, Sternberg announced his new company Entireworld. Entireworld will be on sale April 2, 2018 ==Photography== Sternberg has served as the photographer for all of the Band of Outsider's Polaroid campaign shoots since 2005. The campaigns have been described as "inviting, playful (right up to the point of precious), and in some cases -- Marisa Tomei's comes to mind -- very sexy." Campaign subjects have included: Frank Ocean, Josh Brolin, Amy Adams, Michelle Williams, Ed Ruscha, Jason Schwartzman, Kirsten Dunst, Tom Felton, Rupert Grint, Elena Anaya, James Marsden, Donald Glover, Dave Franco, Leslie Mann, Franka Potente, Marisa Tomei, Bobby Birdman, Sarah Silverman, Max Minghella, Charles Hamilton, Paul Jasmin, John Dewis, and Matt Dallas. ==Awards== CFDA Menswear Designer of the Year (Tie), 2010 CFDA Swarovski Award for New Menswear Designer of the Year, 2009 CFDA Vogue/Fashion Fund Nominee, 2008 ==Notes== Category:Living people Category:American fashion designers Category:California people in design Category:California people in fashion Category:Menswear designers Category:Washington University in St. Louis alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people)
