It was released digitally in Europe on September 30, 2013, and worldwide in digital form and on a limited 1,000 copy 12" vinyl press on 29 October 2013. The EP was made available on Spotify on October 3, 2013. ==Background== On September 13, 2013, Vildhjarta released a music video of the track 'Dimman' and announced their participation in a North American tour with Veil of Maya, Here Comes the Kraken, Northlane, and Structures. On October 1, 2013, Terrorizer premiered the track 'Regnar Bensin'. ==Critical reception== Ultimate Guitar gave the album a 7.5/10, concluding their review by saying "As far as djent goes, Vildhjarta is a pretty interesting group. They do a lot of things right, such as creating very ambient compositions and mixing a lot of "hard" and "soft" sounds so the EP isn't like a non-stop full-on assault from beginning to end. The band shows they aren't afraid to occasionally use clean and acoustic guitars, which really adds a lot of character to their music." The Circle Pit praised the album, awarding it 9.5/10 and writing that "Thousands of Evils rages and fumes and stomps through a good 20+minute long spiral road in five different directions. The only thing common between the record and its predecessor is the same foreboding in the guitar tones, the same unmerciful chugging riffs- but then again, it's a "DIFFERENTLY DARK" fable." Heavy Blog Is Heavy also gave the album a positive review, awarding it 4/5. They wrote that "Hopefully they can take all of the critiques and constructive criticism into consideration when making their follow up LP next year, because this band has extremely high amounts of potential, and are on the right track to reaching it at the fullest. Vildhjarta have found their niche and are sticking with it, and their next album will definitely be an example of that." Premiering the track 'Regnar Bensin', Terrorizer were positive about the EP as well, writing that "Veering from crushing heavy to eerily calm, 'Thousands of Evils' is quite a journey indeed." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Adapted from vinyl liner notes. ===Vildhjarta=== * Daniel Adel - vocals * Vilhelm Bladin - vocals * Johan Nyberg - bass * Daniel Bergstrom - guitar * Calle- Magnus Thomer - guitar * David Lindkvist - drums ===Additional=== * Produced by Daniel Bergstrom * Mixed and mastered by Christian Svedin * Artwork by Rickard Westman * Music written by Daniel Bergstrom and Carl-Magnus Thomer * All orchestration written by Patrick Marchente * All lyrics by Daniel Adel and Vilhelm Bladin ==References== Category:2013 EPs Category:Century Media Records EPs Category:Vildhjarta EPs
