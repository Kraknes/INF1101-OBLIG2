However, he decided to forego the USFL, instead signing a free agent contract with the National Football League's New York Jets on May 5 of that year. Only three months later, Rucks was released by the Jets on August 12. ==Semi-professional career== In 1984, Rucks played for the Racine Gladiators, being named to the all-league and all minor-league teams, and in 1985 for the Chicago Chargers. Inducted into the American Football Association Semi-Pro Hall of Fame in 2002, Rucks would later serve on the Gladiators' (now known as the Racine Raiders) Board of Directors. ==Coaching career== ===High school=== Rucks would go on to be an assistant coach from 1986 until 1988 at Niles North High School in Skokie, Illinois. ===North Park=== Rucks was the head football coach at North Park University in Chicago.
