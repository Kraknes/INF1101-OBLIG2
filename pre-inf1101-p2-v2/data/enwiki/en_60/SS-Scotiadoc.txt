{| |} The Great Lakes freighter SS Scotiadoc was a long, wide, and deep, dry bulk freighter of typical construction style for the early 1900s, primarily designed for the iron ore, coal, and grain trades on the Great Lakes. Commissioned by the Lakewood Steamship Co. of Cleveland, Ohio, SS Martin Mullen was launched as hull number 422 by American Ship Building Co. of Columbus. ==Career== Martin Mullen made frequent trips to and from Duluth-area ports. She was purchased by Paterson Steamships in 1947 and renamed Scotiadoc. ==Final voyage== Scotiadoc was rammed by Canadian steamer Burlington in heavy fog on June 20, 1953, off Trowbridge Island, near the Sleeping Giant in Lake Superior. One crew member died. Captain George Edgar Morris testified that he picked up Burlington on radar when it was five miles away. Burlington collided with the starboard side of Scotiadoc near the stern. ==Discovery of shipwreck== Shipwreck hunters found the wreck in 2013. At a depth of 850 feet, it is among the deepest shipwrecks in the Great Lakes. ==References== ==Further reading== *Scanner Midsummer 1997 (#236) * * Category:1904 ships Category:Great Lakes freighters Category:Ships built in Cleveland Category:Ships sunk in collisions Category:Shipwrecks of Lake Superior
