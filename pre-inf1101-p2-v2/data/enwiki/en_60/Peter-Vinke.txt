Peter Vinke (died 6 September 1702), was an English divine. Vinke matriculated from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, 1641, proceeded B.A. 1643-1644, received his M.A. from Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1647, and received his B.D. in 1654. He was elected a fellow at Pembroke College in 1645. He was admitted to Leiden University in 1648. But he appears to have remained in London, being ordained on 29 November 1649. Later he became rector of St Michael's, Cornhill, London, and then perpetual curate of St Catharine Creechurch, London, from 1661 until 24 August 1662. Vinke was ejected in 1662 after which he continued to minister to a ''considerable audience'' in his own house. John Howe preached his funeral sermon. Vinke was well known for his sermons. On 3 October 1658 he preached a sermon at St. Paul's, London, later published under the title Tes pisteos 'elegchos: or The reason of faith, by order of the Lord Mayor of London, who was in attendance. Four of his sermons were published in the Morning Exercises at Cripplegate. He contributed the commentary on Acts to Matthew Poole's Annotations. == Works == * TES PISTEOS ELEGKhOS: or The Reason of Faith: Briefly discuss'd in a Sermon, Preach'd at Pauls before the Right Honourable, the Lord Mayor, &c.; The third of October, 1658.
