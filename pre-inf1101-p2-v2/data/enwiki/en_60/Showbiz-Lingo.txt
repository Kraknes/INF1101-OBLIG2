Showbiz Lingo (later Showbiz Lingo Plus) was a Philippine weekly entertainment news and talk show. It was first broadcast on August 2, 1992, under the name Showbiz Lingo and on May 11, 1997, after a reformat, as Showbiz Lingo Plus. It was the popular Sunday afternoon talk show on ABS-CBN for almost 7 years until it aired its final episode on June 6, 1999. It featured local celebrity gossip and news, and later would be replaced by The Buzz which would be the longest running talkshow of the network for almost 16 years. ==Cast== ===Main Hosts=== *Cristy Fermin (1992-1999) *Butch Francisco (1992-1997) *Christine Bersola- Babao (1995-1997) *Edu Manzano (1997-1998) *Roderick Paulate (1998-1999) ===Segment Presenters=== *Ogie Diaz (1992-1999) *John Lapus (1992-1999) *Pilar Mateo (1997-1999)http://www.apowell.demon.co.uk/slp99_pages/slp99_slpweek1.html *Aster Amoyo (1997-1999)http://www.apowell.demon.co.uk/slp99_pages/slp99_slpweek1.html *Dolly Anne Carvajal (1997-1999)http://www.apowell.demon.co.uk/slp99_pages/slp99_slpweek1.html ==History== === As Showbiz Lingo (1992-1997) === When the show Rumors: Facts and Humors (spearheaded by Alfie Lorenzo) ended in 1988, ABS-CBN premiered three other showbiz talk shows as its predecessors, Showbiz na Showbiz (1986-1987), Sine Sine, a comedy inspired talk show (1988), and Cinemascoop, a 60 minutes daily late afternoon entertainment news talk show before TV Patrol as a pre-programmed show (hosted by Boy de Guia) (1988-1989), which did not last long. The network conceptualized a new talk show that would be popular with a large audience. Three years later as part of the major change and transition in Philippine television, the management decided to formulate a showbiz-oriented talk show. Showbiz Lingo premiered on August 2, 1992 on a Sunday. It was originally hosted by film reviewer and entertainment columnist Butch Francisco and entertainment columnist Cristy Fermin. Ogie Diaz and John Lapus (a researcher for the show) were introduced as the first reporters; Diaz later was co-host and later Lapus. The show's concept was similar to its predecessor, Rumors: Facts and Humors, wherein the hosts presented the latest showbiz news, controversies and intrigues. Showbiz Lingo built on the concept and added interviews with the stars in a live-panel discussion. Christine Bersola, who was then the anchor of Star News, a segment of ABS-CBN's flagship newscast TV Patrol, joined the show in 1995 as a co-host for two years. === As Showbiz Lingo Plus (1997-1999) === In a reformat, the show's name was changed to Showbiz Lingo Plus on May 11, 1997, and the opening segment was presented by three showbiz writers, Pilar Mateo, Aster Amoyo and Dolly Anne Carvajal, daughter of veteran showbiz reporter Inday Badiday. They joined Butch and Cristy as the team of reporters. Bersola left the show at that time to focus hosting the morning show Alas Singko Y Medya. Francisco left the show as well in 1997 to migrate to the United States. He was replaced by Edu Manzano, who left after one season due to his ongoing term as vice mayor of Makati City (He was elected in 1995). Roderick Paulate came on board as Fermin's co-host and stayed on until the last show episode. The show plummeted in the ratings for the Sunday afternoon slot in 1995 when rival network GMA premiered Startalk hosted by Lolit Solis, Boy Abunda and Kris Aquino. Startalk surpassed Showbiz Lingo in the ratings for a time, but after Aquino left Startalk in 1996, and after reformatting, Showbiz Lingo regained top-rating status. Startalk was moved to the Saturday afternoon slot; it was replaced on Sunday by S-Files, hosted by Paolo Bediones and Lyn Ching, which earned good reviews as well as the 1999 PMPC Star Awards for Television for Best Showbiz Show. Showbiz Lingo Plus aired its last episode on June 6, 1999. The management tapped former "Startalk" host Boy Abunda to host its new entertainment show, The Buzz. Cristy Fermin's daily solo talk show, Cristy Per Minute was discontinued months after Showbiz Lingo Plus ended its run. ==Theme song== The official soundtrack of the program was performed by Dingdong Avanzado, Geneva Cruz, Donita Rose and Ogie Alcasid during the 3rd Anniversary of Showbiz Lingo in August 20, 1995.Showbiz Lingo Jingle ==References== ==See also== *The Buzz *S-Files *Startalk *Eye To Eye *Cristy Per Minute *Cristy Fermin *John Lapus *List of programs aired by ABS-CBN Category:ABS-CBN original programming Category:Entertainment news shows in the Philippines Category:1992 Philippine television series debuts Category:1999 Philippine television series endings Category:Filipino-language television shows
