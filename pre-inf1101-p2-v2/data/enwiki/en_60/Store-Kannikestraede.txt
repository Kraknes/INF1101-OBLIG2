Detail showing Store and Lille Kannikestraede on Gedde's map of the neighbourhood from 1757 Store Kannikestraede in 1862 Kannik is derived from canonicus. The street takes its name after the eight canons associated with Church of Our Lady. After the Reformation, University of Copenhagen took over the Roskilde bishops' premises north of the church (now known as the University Quadrangle). The houses in Store Kannikestraede were used as residences for professors at the University. Ole Worm who lived with his family on the corner of Store Kannikestraede and Fiolstraede established a museum of curiosities in his home. In the early 18th century the University had a total of 11 residences for professors in the street. They were all destroyed along with the other houses in the street in the Copenhagen Fire of 1728. Five of them were rebuilt in 1735 while the other six were not rebuilt until the 1750s. The houses were all designed by Joachim Frederik Ramus, professor in mathematics. They were of considerable size and each contained a single residence, demonstrating the high social status of the professors at the time. The street was pedestrianized on 23 May 1973 along with Kobmagergade and Rosengarden. ==Notable buildings and residents== Regensen's entrance on Store Kannikestraede Three of the oldest halls of residence in Copenhagen are located in the street.
