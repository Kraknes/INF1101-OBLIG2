The Sound of Summer Running is a 1998 studio album by jazz bassist Marc Johnson released by Verve Records. It features an all-star Quartet with guitarists Pat Metheny and Bill Frisell, and John Zorn's frequent drummer Joey Baron. The title was borrowed from a story by Ray Bradbury. ==Reception== Scott Yanow, writing for Allmusic, awarded the album three stars out of five, stating: JazzTimes critic Bill Milkowski, in his review of the album wrote: "... Johnson's Verve debut is bound to send ripples of excitement through the guitar community. "Put Frisell with just about anybody and you're going to create something exciting," says Johnson... Ross Porter in his book The Essential Jazz Recordings: 101 CDs praised Johnson's performance, commenting, "On The Sound of Summer Running Marc Johnson has created both a showcase for his own and others' virtuosity. He plays with warmth and poignancy, and like all great bass players knows his place, never getting in the way. Johnson has made a great record, one that is very satysfying to listen to." The Buffalo News review by Jeff Simon noted, "Irresistible -- a sunbath of a disc by the great bassist that somehow managed to pair guitarists Bill Frisell and Pat Metheny in music virtually impossible to dislike... It's the sort of jazz that has hit potential without compromising all integrity. Summery charm, after all, is the whole point of the disc." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Marc Johnson - double bass *Bill Frisell - electric and acoustic guitars *Pat Metheny - electric and acoustic guitars, 42-string Pikasso guitar *Joey Baron - drums, tambourine Production *Joe Ferla - engineer *Greg Calbi - mastering *Lee Townsend - producer == Notes == *Recorded at Avatar Studios, New York City *Mixed at Sony Music Studios, New York City *Mastered at Masterdisk, New York City == References == Category:1997 albums Category:Albums recorded at Avatar Studios Category:Verve Records albums Category:Marc Johnson (musician) albums
