Bagrat () (1741-1800) was a Georgian royal prince (batonishvili) of the Bagrationi dynasty of Imereti. He was the common ancestor of all male-line descendants of the kings of Imereti, surviving into the 21st century. Prince Bagrat was a younger of King Alexander V of Imereti by his wife, Tamar nee Abashidze. He was, thus, a younger brother of King Solomon I of Imereti and an uncle of Solomon II, the last reigning monarch of Imereti. Prince Bagrat was married to Mariam (1741-1820), daughter of Prince Giorgi, Eristavi of Guria. He had two children: *Prince Simon (born 1771), a natural son, forefather of the noble (aznauri) family of Bagration, which is the only branch of the Imeretian Bagrationi still surviving in Georgia in a male line. *David (1781-1820), a son by Princess Mariam. He was the ancestor of the Princes Bagration, which became extinct in male line in 1937. ==References== Category:1741 births Category:1800 deaths Category:Royalty of Georgia (country) Category:Bagrationi dynasty of the Kingdom of Imereti
