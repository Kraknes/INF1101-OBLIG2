Susanna Sonnenberg is the author of the best-selling memoirs Her Last Death and She Matters. Her Last Death reached #11 and She Matters reached #32 on The New York Times Best Seller list. Both memoirs received wide critical praise. Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times described Last Death as a "fiercely observed, fluently written book that captures the chaos and confusions of [Sonnenberg's] youth" in "sharp, crystalline prose." The New York Times review of She Matters said that Sonnenberg "demonstrates a self-awareness that is clearly hard-earned" and that the "determination to learn from the women who are close to her, to investigate where she failed and where they did, is what gives the book such resonance." Her essays have also been widely published in magazines such as Elle, O, The Oprah Magazine, and Parenting. She is the daughter of Ben Sonnenberg, the American publisher and founder of the literary magazine Grand Street. Born in London and raised in New York, she now lives in Montana with her family. *Reviews of Her Last Death New York Times Oprah Magazine Entertainment Weekly New York Observer San Francisco Chronicle Publisher's Weekly The Book Lady's Blog *Reviews of She Matters New York Times Boston Globe Dallas News San Francisco Chronicle NPR Harpers Bazaar Book Passage Publisher's Weekly Women's Voices for Change ==References== ==External links== Interviews with Susanna Sonnenberg *LA Times *Drinking Diaries *Southeastern Review Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American autobiographers Category:American memoirists
