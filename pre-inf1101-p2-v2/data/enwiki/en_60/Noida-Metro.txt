The Noida Metro is a rapid transit system connecting the twin cities of Noida and Greater Noida in Gautam Buddh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, India. The metro network consists of one line (called Aqua Line), with a total length of serving 21 stations. A second line is planned. The system has all elevated stations using standard-gauge tracks. The services are available from 6:00am to 10:00pm from Monday to Saturday. On Sundays, trains are available between 8:00am and 10:00pm. The trains make 163 trips a day from Monday to Friday using a fleet of 10 trains and the frequency is 10 minutes during peak hours (8:00am-11:00am and 5:00pm-8:00pm) and 15 minutes during off-peak hours. On Saturday and Sunday the frequency is 10 minutes. Initially, the trains are composed of four cars to be extended up to six in the future. Noida Metro is the 11th Metro system to be built in India and 2nd in Uttar Pradesh after Lucknow Metro. It is the sixth longest operational metro network in India after the Delhi Metro, Hyderabad Metro, Chennai Metro, Namma Metro and Kolkata Metro. Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC), a state-owned corporation, is building and owns the system. In the first year, the line will be operated by DMRC. The line connects to Delhi Metro at Noida Sector 51 station. Foundation for the NMRC project was laid down in October 2014, with the construction being commenced by the end of December 2014 by then Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Akhilesh Yadav. Trial runs started in August 2018, and the metro was inaugurated on 25 January 2019 by Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath. ==History== The Uttar Pradesh government approved the construction of a metro line linking Noida with Greater Noida in October 2014. The government also appointed the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) as the turnkey consultant for the project. The detailed project report (DPR) was prepared by the DMRC. A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) called the Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) was formed to implement the project. The Uttar Pradesh Cabinet approved the project and forwarded the DPR to Government of India in October 2013. The Government of India and UP will each bear 20% of the costs and loans from external agencies would be taken to fund the rest 60% of the project. Twenty percent funding from UP will be shared by Noida and Greater Noida Authorities, based on the length of track that passes through the two areas. The NMRC announced on 30 November 2016 that the first line of the metro would be called the Aqua Line. Explaining the choice, NMRC managing director Santosh Yadav stated, "Aqua signifies an eco-friendly colour, which is what we want to portray." The project received safety clearance from the commissioner of metro rail safety (CMRS) on 21 December 2018. The Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) approved an extension of the Aqua Line as part of Phase 2 of the metro project on 4 December 2018. The 15 km extension will link Noida Sector 71 to Knowledge Park 5 in Greater Noida. The extension will consist of nine stations and is expected to cost . The new stations are Sector 122 and Sector 123 in Noida and Sector 4, Ecotech 12, Sectors 2, Sector 3, Sector 10, Sector 12 and Knowledge Park V in Greater Noida. ===Timeline=== ====Phase 1==== Noida Sector 51 to Depot *Oct 2014: UP Government approves the metro project. * Sep 2015: Work progress in around Sec-71, Noida. * Nov 2015: 700 piles (pillar foundation) out of total 5000 have been made. * Feb 2016: NMRC completes first phase of construction in a record time of eight months.
