Syntrophomonas zehnderi is a bacterium. It is anaerobic, syntrophic (in association with methanogens, particularly Methanobacterium formicicum) and fatty acid-oxidizing. The type strain is OL-4T (=DSM 17840T =JCM 13948T). Cells are slightly curved, non-motile rods. ==References== ==Further reading== *Hansen, Kaare H., Birgitte K. Ahring, and Lutgarde Raskin.
