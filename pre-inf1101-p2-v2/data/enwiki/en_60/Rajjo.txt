It tells the love story of Rajjo (Kangana Ranaut) and Chandu (Paras Arora) set against the backdrop of the dying Kothas of Mumbai that nurtured the traditional art of singing and dancing for centuries. The story's central characters are Rajjo, a Muslim girl and Chandu, a young Brahmin boy. When Chandu helps his team win a cricket match, the team decides to celebrate the victory by visiting the Kothas of Nagpada. This is where Chandu meets Rajjo who mesmerizes him with her elegant Mujra dance and it is love at first sight for him. Chandu belongs to a family of music lovers; he is a very good harmonium player, his mother is a Bhajan singer. Rajjo is trained under Kothewali Amma; she is naughty, sweet and quite attractive. Music is the common thread between them, as is the strong attraction that draws Rajjo and Chandu together and seals their love. Simultaneously the Nagpada area goes under the clutches of re-development and all the dancers and singers are under the shadow of this potential danger. Amidst these circumstances, Rajjo and Chandu have to deal with Begum (Mahesh Manjrekar) who runs the Kotha and Hande Bhau (Prakash Raj), a corporator with powerful political connections who has his eye on Rajjo. ==Cast== * Kangana Ranaut as Rajjo * Paras Arora as Chandu * Sadhana Sharma as Chanda Chandu's Sister * Mahesh Manjrekar as Begum * Prakash Raj as Hande Bhau * Jaya Prada as Jankidevi * Sharad Shelar *Deepika Amin as Kamladevi * Alok as Chandu's Friend *Rakesh Barsewal as Hijra *Shruti Bhist as Young Rajjo *Swati Chitnis as Ammi *Avtar Gill as Acharya Deshbhushan *Ravi Hande as Vikram Hande *Ateshan Hussein as Jaggu (Govind Hande's PA) *Anand Ingle as Meghraj Shetty *Kinjal Jain as Chandu's Sister *Jaiveer as Chandu's Friend *Kishore Kadam as Daadi Patil * Mazhar Khan as Hirja *Suhaas Khandke as Professor *Shubhangi Latkar as Chandu's Mother *Upendra Limaye as Inspector Salunkhe *Manmauji as Chacha (Garage) * Naren as NGO guy *Girish Pal as Hirja *Atul Patil as Chotelal *Piyusha Patil as Sana *Poonam Preet as Acharya Deshbhushan's PA *Aarti Rana as Kotha Girl *Shivani Rawat as *Rutwik as Chandu's Friend * Sachi as Salunke's Daughter *Rajesh Sahu as Hirja *Kuldeep Sarin as C.M. *Sumit Senapati as Chandu's Friend *Nitesh Shah as Chandu's Friend *Vipin Sharma as Chandu's Father *Rizwana Sheikh as Kotha Girl *Shashank Shende as Gannewala *Soham Shah as NGO guy *Dalip Tahil as Lala Pathan *C.P.
