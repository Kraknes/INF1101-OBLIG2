The series moved to FX's sister network FXX with first two episodes back-to-back on June 25, 2014 and the final two episodes aired on August 13. David Zuckerman, who served as showrunner for the first two seasons, returned as co-showrunner after stepping down in season 3. The roles of Catherine and Bruce had to be recast after Mary Steenburgen and Dwight Yoakam were unable to reprise their respective roles due to scheduling conflict, and they were replace by Mimi Rodgers and William Balwin. The crew was given warning well ahead of time so the show's creators could tie up loose ends with the final season. The decision to end the series was ultimately made by FX. Jason Gann was intent on continuing the series stating, "We would have kept going. I think you would have to be crazy to quit a job like this." The return of show runner David Zuckerman, coupled with the focus on answering some of the show's deeper mythological questions, prevented Gann from writing any episodes in the final season. Elijah Wood has stated that "Answers" is one of his favorite episodes of the series saying "I read the season kind of in order and I read like one through three and then I read four and it just totally blew my mind." His friend has taken the basement set and recreated it at his house. Wood himself has possession of a stuffed bear and a bong made from a Gatorade bottle, both featured prominently throughout the series. ==Notes== == References == == External links == * * Season 4 Category:2014 American television seasons
