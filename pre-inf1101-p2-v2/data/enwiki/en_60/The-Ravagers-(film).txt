The commandant of the Japanese forces occupying the Philippines is ordered to transport a shipment of gold bullion back to Japan. The Japanese soldiers take over a convent where the gold shipment is situated, and take a number of nuns and young girls prisoner in the process. Unbeknownst to the Japanese, one of the captive women is actually a female American agent named Sheila (Bronwyn FitzSimons), whom the Japanese have been looking to capture. Kermit Dowling (John Saxon), an American army officer, together with an ex-convict named Gaudiel (Fernando Poe Jr.), leads a group of Filipino freedom fighters in an attack on the convent.
