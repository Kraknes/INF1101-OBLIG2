Pomona is a Maya archaeological site in the Mexican state of Tabasco, municipality of Tenosique, about 30 miles (50 km) east of Palenque. Its flowering was in the Late Classic period. ==Site== Pomona is a dispersed settlement built in a fertile, hilly region and belonging to the Usumacinta river sites. It was discovered in 1959 and has been investigated, albeit only very partially, between 1986 and 1988. It consists of a total of six archaeological complexes, only the northernmost one of which, a quadrangular plaza with 13 buildings, has been explored. ==History== Fig. 2: Pomona relief panel, Rietberg Museum, Zurich Fig. 3: Pomona relief panel 1, Museo del sitio de Pomona, Tabasco There are texts at Pomona referring to dates as early as 297 CE, but little more is known from this time period.Martin & Grube (2000), p. 140. In 659 CE, Palenque captured six lords in battle. One was said to be from Pipa', a location associated with the site of Pomona. Another Pipa' lord was said to have died in 663.Martin & Grube (2000), p. 164165. A king of Pomona rose to the throne under the supervision of K'inich Kan Bahlam III of Palenque in 751 CE.Martin & Grube (2000), p. 174. In March 792 CE, Piedras Negras attacked Pomona and took prisoners (depicted on Piedras Negras stela 12); the same happened two years later.
