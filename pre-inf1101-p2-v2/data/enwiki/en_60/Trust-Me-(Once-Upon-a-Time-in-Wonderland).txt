The show placed fifth in its timeslot and twelfth for the night. Alex Strachan of Canada.com said, in regards to ratings, "Wonderland's future may well depend on a change of scenery -- a new day and time, no pun intended -- where it can be given room to breathe and find an audience" as the series faces competition with The Big Bang Theory. ===Critical reception=== Amy Ratcliffe of IGN gave the episode an 8.6 out of 10, giving it a positive review. She said "It's just the beginning of the series, but the chess board is set and we're in for an exciting game. Every character has spirit and is moving toward a defined purpose. The evil characters don't seem like they're going to change sides every five minutes, and that's such a relief. Unlike other shows. You know what I'm talking about here. Cough cough, Evil Queen." Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a mixed to negative review, commenting on how the mood of each scene changed too rapidly.
