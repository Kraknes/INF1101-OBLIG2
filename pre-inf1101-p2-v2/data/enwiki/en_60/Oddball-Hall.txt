Film reviewer Leonard Maltin criticized Oddball Hall and gave it two stars; while he wrote that the film was good- natured and simplistic, he felt that it was not funny. Author Mick Martin, in his book Video Movie Guide, called the film a "flat comedy of mistaken identities." Kevin Thomas of The New York Times wrote that the film was "complicated" and "unfunny" despite starring Meredith and Ameche. Keith Bailey, of The Unknown Movies, wrote that "Oddball Hall is...well...odd. That may be why the major studio that picked this up never, to my knowledge, theatrically released this. Though odder is the question why they picked it up in the first place. While there are few actively bad sequences, the whole exercise is slow, uneventful, and largely unfunny." ==References== ==External links== * Category:1991 films Category:1991 comedy films Category:Direct-to- video comedy films
