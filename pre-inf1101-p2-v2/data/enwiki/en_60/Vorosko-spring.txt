Vorosko-spring is a fresh water spring in the Bukk Mountains in Hungary, not far from Felsotarkany. The name "Vorosko" means "red stone" in Hungarian. The spring works periodically, usually for 3-4 months after melting period. It is part of the Bukk National Park. == Approach == The Vorosko-Spring is located in the western part of the Bukk Mountains, to the north from Felsotarkany village. It is approachable from Felsotarkany by the Felsotarkany National Forest Railway. From the final stop of the railway, the spring is approachable on foot in the most comfortable way. Cyclists can also approach it following the railroad. The place of the spring is easily recognisable; because of the high water pressure, the water is coming out to the surface in a big concreted area. == About the spring == Under the southern fringe of the limestone- plateau of the Bukk Mountain, in 450-500m height above sea level, four periodical karst springs have their source. The best-known of them is the Vorosko-spring. The precipitation falling on the limestone-plateau of the Bukk Mountain leaks into the rock. As a result, the amount of the karstwater increases and rises as springs. == References == *Geocaching.hu fenykepes bejegyzesek *Karpat-medence utikonyv Category:Springs of Hungary
