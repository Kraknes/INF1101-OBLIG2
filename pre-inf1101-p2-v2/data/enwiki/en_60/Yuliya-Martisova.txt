Yuliya Viktorovna Martisova (also Julia Martisova, ; born 15 June 1976 in Velikiye Luki, Pskov Oblast) is a Russian professional road cyclist. She has awarded two Russian championship titles (2005 and 2008) in the women's road race, and later represented her nation Russia at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Martisova currently races for Italy's pro cycling team during the 2013 annual season. ==Racing career== Since her professional debut in 2000, Martisova made the worldwide headlines in her sporting career, following her tremendous success in the women's road race at the 2005 Russian Championships. Strong results landed her spot on the P.M.B. Fenix Cycling Team in Italy under an exclusive three-year contract, and eventually added another title in her career hardware from the seventh stage of Tour De L'Aude Cycliste Feminin in Languedoc-Roussillon, France. When her contract with Fenix expired shortly, Martisova transferred to Gauss RDZ-Ormu pro cycling team in 2008, and stayed for four consecutive seasons. Furthermore, she recaptured her title in the same category at the Russian Championships on the same year. Martisova qualified for the Russian squad in the women's road race at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing by receiving one of the nation's three available berths from the UCI World Cup. She scored a career-high, twelfth place as the top Russian cyclist on a grueling race against sixty-five other riders in 3:32:45, finishing more than twenty-one seconds behind Olympic champion Nicole Cooke of Great Britain. At the 2011 UCI Road World Championships, Martisova could not chase four other riders from the leading group on the final lap, as she sprinted towards the finish line with a fifth-place effort in 3:21:28, narrowly missing out the podium by a short distance. In 2012, Martisova renounced her membership in Gauss, and instead signed a one-year exclusive contract with Italy's BePink ladies' cycling team. ==Career highlights== ;2000 : 2nd Stage 3, Grande Boucle Feminine Internationale, France : 3rd Russian Championships (Road), Russia ;2001 : 2nd Overall, Trophee d'Or Feminin, France :: 1st Stage 1 ;2002 : 2nd Stage 5, Giro d'Italia Donne, Italy : 3rd Stage 3, Giro d'Italia Donne, Italy ;2005 : 1st 20px Russian Championships (Road), Russia : 1st Stage 7, Tour De L'Aude Cycliste Feminin, Languedoc-Roussillon (FRA) : 2nd Stage 2, Tour de l'Ardeche, Beauchastel (FRA) : 2nd Stage 3, Tour De L'Aude Cycliste Feminin, Languedoc-Roussillon (FRA) : 3rd Stage 1b, Tour de l'Ardeche, Cruas (FRA) : 3rd Stage 3b Giro della Toscana Int.
