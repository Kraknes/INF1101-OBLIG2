Raphael Rossi Branco (born 25 July 1990), sometimes known as Raphael or Rapha Branco, is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a defender for Swiss Super League club FC Sion. He began his career with Porto Alegre and moved to Europe in 2011 to join Brighton & Hove Albion, and then nearby Whitehawk, where he won the 2012-13 Isthmian League. He then signed for Swindon Town, playing 131 official matches and scoring seven goals for the League One club before joining Boavista in 2017 and Sion a year later. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Born in Campinas, Sao Paulo, Branco debuted professionally for Porto Alegre and was spotted by an agent who was friend of Gus Poyet, then Brighton & Hove Albion manager. He went on a trial for the English club and an offer to sign for the team was stalled until the player could get an Italian passport. After that, Brighton demanded a statement from Branco's former youth clubs in which they would not receive future compensation, otherwise the club would have to pay PS200,000 to register him, which meant he would be released. After unsuccessful trials in Europe and Brazil, he went to play again in England for Brighton-based club Whitehawk. Since he was signing for a non-professional club, he did not need any agreement with his former clubs and could move to other clubs for free. With Whitehawk, Branco won the 2012-13 Isthmian League. ===Swindon Town=== On 2 August 2013, he joined Swindon Town on a one year-deal after impressing on a pre-season trip to Portugal after being invited by a former Brighton & Hove Albion assistant. He was first called up for a matchday squad on 31 August, remaining unused as Swindon won 5-0 at the County Ground in a League One game against Crewe Alexandra. He made his debut on 8 October in the second round of the Football League Trophy, playing the entirety of a 2-1 victory over League Two team Plymouth Argyle. On 29 December he made his first league appearance, replacing the injured Grant Hall in the 53rd minute of a 1-1 draw away to Bradford City. He was given his first league start on 14 January 2014, playing the full 90 minutes of a 0-2 loss away to Stevenage. In total he played 18 matches over his first season, 15 of which were in the league. He signed a new one-year contract on 30 June 2014. On 30 August, he scored the first goal of his professional career, heading from Nathan Byrne's cross to equalise in a 1-1 home league draw against Coventry City. In December, having previously been told that he had played his last game, he signed a further contract. Branco scored again on 7 February 2015, opening the scoring from John Swift's pass in a 2-0 home win over Barnsley which put Swindon into second place in League One. He scored the only goal on 14 March to win away at Port Vale, heading in Harry Toffolo's corner in the eighth minute. Branco was an unused substitute on 24 May as Swindon lost 0-4 to Preston North End in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium. Swindon were relegated in Branco's final season, 2016-17. On 8 October 2016, he was sent off for elbowing Lawrie Wilson in a 1-0 home loss to Bolton Wanderers. ===Boavista=== On 16 June 2017, Branco signed a two-year deal with Primeira Liga club Boavista. He made his debut on 20 August in a 1-0 loss at Maritimo, and scored his first goal for them a week later, the game's only in a home victory against Aves. ===FC Sion=== In June 2018, Branco signed a three-year deal with Swiss club FC Sion. ==Playing style== In addition to central defence, Branco can play at right-back and midfield. His favourite player is compatriot defender David Luiz. ==Personal life== His older brother Igor, also a defender, plays for Al-Faisaly in the Saudi Professional League. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center" |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=2|League !colspan=2|FA Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|FL Trophy !colspan=2|OtherIncludes other competitive competitions such as the Football League Play-Offs !colspan=2|Total |- !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- |rowspan="2"|Porto Alegre |2010 |10||2||colspan="2"|--||colspan="2"|--||colspan="2"|--||colspan="2"|--||10||2 |- !Total !10!!2!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!10!!2 |- |rowspan="2"|Brighton & Hove Albion |2011-12 |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !Total !0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0 |- |rowspan="2"|Whitehawk |2012-13 |29||3||colspan="2"|--||colspan="2"|--||colspan="2"|--||colspan="2"|--||29||3 |- !Total !29!!3!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!29!!3 |- |rowspan="5"|Swindon Town |2013-14 |15||0||0||0||0||0||3||0||0||0||18||0 |- |2014-15 |30||3||1||0||2||0||0||0||1||0||34||3 |- |2015-16 |36||1||1||0||1||0||2||0||0||0||40||1 |- |2016-17 |34||2||2||0||0||0||3||1||0||0||39||3 |- !Total !115!!6!!4!!0!!3!!0!!8!!1!!1!!0!!131!!7 |- |rowspan="2"|Boavista |2017-18 |30||3||1||0||colspan="2"|--||colspan="2"|--||colspan="2"|--||31||3 |- !Total !30!!3!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!31!!3 |- |rowspan="1"|FC Sion |2018-19 |10||1||1||0||colspan="2"|--||colspan="2"|--||colspan="2"|--||11||1 |- !colspan="2"|Career total !212!!15!!6!!0!!3!!0!!8!!1!!1!!0!!197!!16 |} ==References== ==External links== * *Profile at the official Swindon Town website Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian people of Italian descent Category:Sportspeople from Campinas Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Brazilian expatriate footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Porto Alegre Futebol Clube players Category:Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. players Category:Whitehawk F.C. players Category:Swindon Town F.C. players Category:Boavista F.C. players Category:FC Sion players Category:Isthmian League players Category:English Football League players Category:Primeira Liga players Category:Swiss Super League players Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Expatriate footballers in Portugal Category:Expatriate footballers in Switzerland Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Portugal
