September 2012 aerial photograph of Vartahamnen. Vartahamnen is a port in Stockholm, Sweden. Vartahamnen and the adjacent Stockholm Free Port at Lilla Vartan is Stockholm's main port. Vartahamnen primarily serves passenger ferries for the shipping company Silja Line as well as freighters for Tallink operating in Aland Islands and Estonia. The port also services the SeaWind Line and the coal/biofuel power plant in Hjorthagen. Vartahamnen is located in the Gardet and Hjorthagen districts. The structure was built in 1879-1886 after the city bought land in order to create a port for coal and other bulk goods. Rail freight and passenger traffic were routed through the Vartabanan line when the Vartan station was inaugurated in 1882. The port was widened and deepened gradually during the early 1900s, and in 1903 the nearby coal-fired Vartaverket plant was inaugurated. In 1904, a municipal building was added which served as the customs and port offices. ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Ports and harbours of Sweden Category:Buildings and structures in Stockholm Category:Transport in Stockholm
